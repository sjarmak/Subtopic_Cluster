{"abstract": "OpenAI has released the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and revolutionized the approach in artificial intelligence to human-model interaction. Several publications on ChatGPT evaluation test its effectiveness on well-known natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the existing studies are mostly non-automated and tested on a very limited scale. In this work, we examined ChatGPT's capabilities on 25 diverse analytical NLP tasks, most of them subjective even to humans, such as sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, offensiveness, and stance detection. In contrast, the other tasks require more objective reasoning like word sense disambiguation, linguistic acceptability, and question answering. We also evaluated GPT-4 model on five selected subsets of NLP tasks. We automated ChatGPT and GPT-4 prompting process and analyzed more than 49k responses. Our comparison of its results with available State-of-the-Art (SOTA) solutions showed that the average loss in quality of the ChatGPT model was about 25% for zero-shot and few-shot evaluation. For GPT-4 model, a loss for semantic tasks is significantly lower than for ChatGPT. We showed that the more difficult the task (lower SOTA performance), the higher the ChatGPT loss. It especially refers to pragmatic NLP problems like emotion recognition. We also tested the ability to personalize ChatGPT responses for selected subjective tasks via Random Contextual Few-Shot Personalization, and we obtained significantly better user-based predictions. Additional qualitative analysis revealed a ChatGPT bias, most likely due to the rules imposed on human trainers by OpenAI. Our results provide the basis for a fundamental discussion of whether the high quality of recent predictive NLP models can indicate a tool's usefulness to society and how the learning and validation procedures for such systems should be established.", "title": ["ChatGPT: Jack of all trades, master of none"], "year": "2023"}

{"abstract": "Context. A large number of globular clusters in the Milky Way have been studied in recent years, especially in hidden regions such as those of the Galactic bulge. <BR /> Aims: The main goal of this work is to understand what we can learn if we include these new objects into the Milky Way globular cluster (GC) system that we know today. We compiled a catalog of 37 recently discovered globular clusters. Most of them are located in the Galactic bulge, but we also included some of the GCs for comparison. <BR /> Methods: We used a range of distributions for investigating the Galactic GC system based on the metallicity, luminosity function, and age. We considered three samples. We first treated the new GC sample separately from the known and well characterized GCs. Consequently, we merged these two samples, thereby upgrading the Milky Way GC system. Furthermore, we performed a comparison between our clusters sample and the field star population. <BR /> Results: We found a double-peaked distribution for the luminosity function, which shows an elongated faint end tail. Considering the \"merged\" sample, the luminosity function peaks at M<SUB>V</SUB><SUP>up</SUP> = \u22127.00 \u00b1 1.3 mag and at M<SUB>V</SUB><SUP>up</SUP> = \u22124.1 \u00b1 0.48 mag. The metallicity distributions also display a bimodality trend. In this case, we compare our new sample compilation with previously published ones, finding that the distributions are in good general agreement. We also constructed the metallicity distribution for the field star sample and, by comparing it with that of the GCs, we learned that a high percentage of field stars show [Fe/H] &gt; 0; whereas we did not detect any GCs in the same metallicity range. To understand this inconsistency, we constructed the age-metallicity diagram for both samples, noting that the old and metal-poor population (age \u2265 8 Gyr and [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.0) is represented by Gcs, while the young and metal-rich population (age &lt; 8 Gyr and [Fe/H] &gt; \u22121.0) corresponds to field stars. <BR /> Conclusions: From the analysis of the GC luminosity function and metallicity distribution, we can conclude that many GCs, probably those that are very faint, have survived strong dynamical processes that are typical of the bulge regions. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of them have been accreted during past merging events, especially the metal-poor component, whereas the metal-rich population may be related to the formation of the bulge and/or disk. Finally, the difference that we notice between the cluster and field star samples should be explored in the context of the evolutionary differences among these two stellar populations.", "title": ["Over 200 globular clusters in the Milky Way and still none with super-Solar metallicity"], "year": "2024"}
{"abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation in the hippocampus have received much attention because of the likely functional importance of synaptic plasticity for information storage and the development of neuronal connectivity. Surprisingly, it remains unclear whether activity modifies the strength of individual synapses in a digital (all-or-none) or analog (graded) manner. Here we characterize step-like all-or-none transitions from baseline synaptic transmission to potentiated states following protocols for inducing potentiation at putative single CA3-CA1 synaptic connections. Individual synapses appear to have all-or-none potentiation indicative of highly cooperative processes but different thresholds for undergoing potentiation. These results raise the possibility that some forms of synaptic memory may be stored in a digital manner in the brain.", "title": ["All-Or-None Potentiation at CA3-CA1 Synapses"], "year": "1998"}
{"abstract": "We systematically investigate Vandorou et al.'s claim to have detected the host star of the low-mass-ratio (q &lt; 10<SUP>-4</SUP>) microlensing planet OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb, via Keck adaptive optics (AO) measurements \u0394t = 4.12 yr after the event's peak (t <SUB>0</SUB>). If correct, this measurement would contradict the microlens-parallax measurement derived from Spitzer observations taken near t <SUB>0</SUB>. We show that this host identification would be in 4\u03c3 conflict with the original ground-based relative lens-source proper-motion measurements. By contrast, Gould estimated a probability p = 10% that the \"other star\" resolved by single-epoch late-time AO would be a companion to the host or the microlensed source, which is much more probable than a 4\u03c3 statistical fluctuation. Independent of this proper-motion discrepancy, the kinematics of this host identification are substantially less probable than those of the Spitzer solution. Hence, this identification should not be accepted, pending additional observations that would either confirm or contradict it, which could be taken in 2023. Motivated by this tension, we present two additional investigations. We explore the possibility that Vandorou et al. identified the wrong \"star\" for their analysis. Astrometry of KMT and Keck images favors a star (or asterism) lying about 175 mas northwest of Vandorou et al.'s star. We also present event parameters from a combined fit to all survey data, which yields a more precise mass ratio, q = (4.6 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10<SUP>-5</SUP>.

This appears natural in the most general ghost-free, bimetric theory of gravity, where it unlocks an additional symmetry with respect to the exchange of the metrics.

It is shown that if the two metrics couple minimally to matter, then there is no physical metric to which all matter would universally couple, and that moreover such an effective metric generically does not exist even for an individual matter species.

Overpass coincidence criteria of \u00b12 h and within a 40 km radius are satisfied at least once at 149 globally distributed AERONET sites from 2006 to 2010. Most data pairs (&gt;80%) use AERONET measurements acquired \u00b130 min of the overpass. We examine the differences in AOD estimates between CALIOP and AERONET for various aerosol, environmental, and geographic conditions. Results show CALIOP AOD are lower than AERONET AOD especially at low optical depths as measured by AERONET (500 nm AOD &lt; 0.1). Furthermore, the median relative AOD difference between the two measurements is 25% of the AERONET AOD for AOD &gt; 0.1. Differences in AOD between CALIOP and AERONET are possibly due to cloud contamination, scene inhomogeneity, instrument view angle differences, CALIOP retrieval errors, and detection limits. Comparison of daytime to nighttime number of 5 km \u00d7 60 m (60 m in the vertical) features detected by CALIOP show that there are 20% more aerosol features at night.

{"abstract": "Accuracies of self-reports of household energy consumption were examined among a sample of 2090 electricity and 1699 fuel oil and natural gas consumers. Information obtained from self-reports allowed an increase in response of 37% over what could be obtained from utility company files. Errors in measures as a result of self-reporting occurred, ranging between 10.5% and 12.6% and 24.6% and 29.3%, depending upon fuel type and respondents' use of household receipts. There was no apparent tendency toward systematic over-or underreporting, with the exception of underreporting among larger users. Selfreports correlated more highly with actual consumption than did scores computed to replace missing data. Relationships among variables did not vary significantly between subgroups of respondents for which utility records were and were not obtained. It is concluded that no great error is introduced into findings by researchers' use of self-reports of household energy consumption, either in terms of parameter estimation or in the calculation of relationships among variables.

{"abstract": "Mass spectrometry of charged derivatives of peptides has been a growing area of interest in the past decade. Fragmentation of charged derivatives of peptides is believed to be different from than that of protonated peptides when analyzed by collisionally activated dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry (CAD-MS/MS). The charged derivatives fragment by charge-remote fragmentation mechanisms, which are usually classified as high-energy (HE)-CAD processes. Our objective in the present study is to investigate the mechanism of fragmentation of charged derivatives of peptides when analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-post-source decay-mass spectrometry (MALDI-PSD-MS) and electrospray ionization (ESI)-CAD-MS/MS (ion trap), which involve low-energy processes. Three major types of hydrogens (\u03b1, \u03b2, and amide) are available for migration during the formation of the *a<SUB>n</SUB> ions (the predominant ion series produced from these charged derivatives). To pinpoint which of the three hydrogens is involved in the formation of the *a<SUB>n</SUB> ions, deuterium-labeled peptide derivatives with labels at specific sites were synthesized and analyzed by MALDI-PSD-MS and ESI-CAD-MS/MS. Our results suggest that the amide hydrogen of the residue at which the cleavage occurs shifts during the formation of *a<SUB>n</SUB>; this observation serves as evidence for the mechanism proposed earlier by Liao et al. for fragmentation of such charged derivatives. The results also help elucidate the structure of the *a<SUB>n</SUB> ions, *b<SUB>n</SUB> ions, and others formed during cleavage at the proline residue, as well as the ions formed during loss of the C-terminal residue from these charged derivatives.", "title": ["Mass spectrometric evidence for mechanisms of fragmentation of charge-derivatized peptides"], "year": "2001"}
{"abstract": "The Asteroid Terrestrial impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) system consists of two 0.5 m Schmidt telescopes with cameras covering 29 square degrees at plate scale of 1.86 arcsec per pixel.

Construction is underway of two further units to be sited in Chile and South Africa which will result in an all-sky daily cadence from 2021. Initially designed for detecting potentially hazardous near earth objects, the ATLAS data enable a range of astrophysical time domain science.

Here we describe the hardware and software infrastructure to produce a stream of clean, real, astrophysical transients in real time. This involves machine learning and boosted decision tree algorithms to identify extragalactic and Galactic transients.

{"abstract": "As the permafrost region warms, its large organic carbon pool will be increasingly vulnerable to decomposition, combustion, and hydrologic export. Models predict that some portion of this release will be offset by increased production of Arctic and boreal biomass; however, the lack of robust estimates of net carbon balance increases the risk of further overshooting international emissions targets. Precise empirical or model-based assessments of the critical factors driving carbon balance are unlikely in the near future, so to address this gap, we present estimates from 98 permafrost-region experts of the response of biomass, wildfire, and hydrologic carbon flux to climate change. Results suggest that contrary to model projections, total permafrost-region biomass could decrease due to water stress and disturbance, factors that are not adequately incorporated in current models. Assessments indicate that end-of-the-century organic carbon release from Arctic rivers and collapsing coastlines could increase by 75% while carbon loss via burning could increase four-fold. Experts identified water balance, shifts in vegetation community, and permafrost degradation as the key sources of uncertainty in predicting future system response. In combination with previous findings, results suggest the permafrost region will become a carbon source to the atmosphere by 2100 regardless of warming scenario but that 65%-85% of permafrost carbon release can still be avoided if human emissions are actively reduced.", "title": ["Biomass offsets little or none of permafrost carbon release from soils, streams, and wildfire: an expert assessment"], "year": "2016"}
{"abstract": "Recent studies note a significant increase in high-pressure blocking over the Greenland region (Greenland Blocking Index, GBI) in summer since the 1990s. Such a general circulation change, indicated by a negative trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, is generally highlighted as a major driver of recent surface melt records observed on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). Here we compare reanalysis-based GBI records with those from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) suite of global climate models over 1950-2100. We find that the recent summer GBI increase lies well outside the range of modelled past reconstructions and future GBI projections (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The models consistently project a future decrease in GBI (linked to an increase in NAO), which highlights a likely key deficiency of current climate models if the recently observed circulation changes continue to persist. Given well-established connections between atmospheric pressure over the Greenland region and air temperature and precipitation extremes downstream, e.g. over northwest Europe, this brings into question the accuracy of simulated North Atlantic jet stream changes and resulting climatological anomalies over densely populated regions of northern Europe as well as of future projections of GrIS mass balance produced using global and regional climate models.", "title": ["Brief communication: Recent changes in summer Greenland blocking captured by none of the CMIP5 models"], "year": "2018"}

{"abstract": "Historically, the following three approaches to synthesize materials with new atomic structures and, thus, new properties may be distinguished. In the first period - beginning with the discovery of metals about 5000 years ago - the atomic structure of crystalline metallic materials was modified by introducing crystal defects, e.g. by hammering or rolling. However, even at the maximum defect density achievable by this approach (about 10 <SUP>12</SUP> dislocations per cm <SUP>2</SUP>) only about 1% of the atoms are located in the cores of the crystal defects where the atomic structure deviates significantly from the one in the perfect crystal lattice. In other words, this approach does not permit the generation of crystalline materials, the atomic arrangements of which deviate significantly (i.e. in a large volume fraction of the material) from the atomic arrangement in perfect crystals with the same chemical composition. Many crystalline materials used commercially today are based on this approach. In the second approach, the way to a class of materials with new atomic structures was opened about 35 years ago by having up to 50% of the atoms located in cores of grain boundaries and/or interphase boundaries. Materials of this kind were obtained by reducing the crystal size of polycrystals to a few nanometers. These materials were called nanocrystalline or nanostructured materials. As the atomic arrangements in the cores of grain and/or interphase boundaries differ from the ones in perfect crystals, this approach led to materials with new properties (in comparison to the chemically identical single crystals). In the most recent, third approach, a new class of materials with a glassy structure is synthesized. Their novel feature is that the atomic structure throughout the entire volume of the material as well as the density of the entire material can be tuned. Materials of this kind are called nanoglasses. They are generated by introducing interfaces into metallic glasses on a nanometer scale. These interfaces delocalize upon annealing, so that the free volume associated with the interfaces spreads throughout the volume of the glass. This delocalization changes the atomic structure and density of the glass throughout the volume. In fact, by controlling the spacing between the interfaces introduced into the glass as well as their degree of delocalization (by modifying the annealing time and/or annealing temperature), the atomic structures as well as the density (and hence all structure/density-dependent properties) of nanoglasses may be controlled. A reduction of the density by up to 15% seems to be possible. A comparable tuning of the atomic structure/density of crystalline materials is not conceivable because defects in crystals (grain boundaries, dislocations, etc.) do not delocalize upon annealing.", "title": ["Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own: Are there ways to synthesize materials beyond the limitations of today?"], "year": "2008"}

{"abstract": "Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging provides a fascinating way to see through obstacles. As one of the dominating NLOS imaging approaches, transient NLOS imaging uses ultrafast illumination and detection to sense hidden objects. Because ultrafast array detectors still face challenges in manufacture or cost, most existing transient NLOS imaging schemes use a point detector and therefore need a point-by-point scanning (PPS) process, rendering a relative low detection efficiency and long imaging time. In this work, we apply a passive mode single-pixel camera to implement spatial multiplexing detection (SMD) in NLOS imaging and achieve a higher efficiency of data acquisition. We analyze and demonstrate the superiority of SMD through both simulation and experiment. We also demonstrate a SMD scheme with compressed sensing (CS) strategy. A compression ratio as low as 18% is achieved. By utilizing SMD, we accomplish a boost of detection efficiency of up to 5 times compared with the traditional PPS mode.

{"abstract": "Apophenia describes the experience of seeing meaningful patterns or connections in random or meaningless data.

{"abstract": "Using sampling experiments, we found that, when there are fewer groups than variables, between-groups PCA (bgPCA) may suggest surprisingly distinct differences among groups for data in which none exist. While apparently not noticed before, the reasons for this problem are easy to understand. A bgPCA captures the g \u2011 1 dimensions of variation among the g group means, but only a fraction of the <inline-formula id=\"IEq1\"><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mo>\u2211</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> dimensions of within-group variation (<inline-formula id=\"IEq2\"><mml:math><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> are the sample sizes), when the number of variables, p, is greater than g \u2011 1. This introduces a distortion in the appearance of the bgPCA plots because the within-group variation will be underrepresented, unless the variables are sufficiently correlated so that the total variation can be accounted for with just g \u2011 1 dimensions. The effect is most obvious when sample sizes are small relative to the number of variables, because smaller samples spread out less, but the distortion is present even for large samples. Strong covariance among variables largely reduces the magnitude of the problem, because it effectively reduces the dimensionality of the data and thus enables a larger proportion of the within-group variation to be accounted for within the g \u2011 1-dimensional space of a bgPCA. The distortion will still be relevant though its strength will vary from case to case depending on the structure of the data (p, g, covariances etc.). These are important problems for a method mainly designed for the analysis of variation among groups when there are very large numbers of variables and relatively small samples. In such cases, users are likely to conclude that the groups they are comparing are much more distinct than they really are. Having many variables but just small sample sizes is a common problem in fields ranging from morphometrics (as in our examples) to molecular analyses.", "title": ["Seeing Distinct Groups Where There are None: Spurious Patterns from Between-Group PCA"], "year": "2019"}

{"abstract": "The collision dynamics of the NO+Ne system is investigated in a molecular beam scattering experiment at a collision energy of 1055 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. Employing resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization of NO, we measured state-resolved integral and differential cross sections for the excitation to various levels of both spin-orbit manifolds. The dependence of the scattered intensity on the laser polarization is used to extract differential quadrupole moments for the collision induced angular momentum alignment. The set of cross section data is compared with results of a full quantum mechanical close coupling calculation using the set of ab initio potential energy surfaces of Alexander et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 114, 5588 (2001)]. In previous work, it was found that the positions and rotational substructures for the lowest bend-stretch vibrational states derived from these surfaces agree very well with the observed spectrum of the NO-Ne complex. For the same potential, we find that the calculated cross sections show a less satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. While the overall J<SUB>f</SUB> dependence and magnitude of the integral and differential cross sections are in good agreement, noticeable discrepancies exist for the angle dependence of the differential cross sections. In general, the calculated rotational rainbow structures are shifted towards larger scattering angles indicating that the anisotropy of the potential is overestimated in the fit to the ab initio points or in the ab initio calculation itself. For most states, we find the measured alignment moments to be in excellent agreement with the results of the calculation as well as with predictions of sudden models. Significant deviations from the sudden models are observed only for those fine-structure changing collisions which are dominated by forward scattering. Results of the full quantum calculation confirm the deviations for these states.", "title": ["Molecular beam scattering of NO+Ne: A joint theoretical and experimental study"], "year": "2004"}

Although these noncanonical purine nucleotides are known to engage in non-Watson-Crick pairing with their canonical purine counterparts, their behavior in nonenzymatic RNA copying has not been evaluated. Our study indicates that none of the 8-oxo-purines behaves as a suitable substrate for nonenzymatic RNA copying.

{"abstract": "Host selection by phytophagous insects is generally thought to be based on chemical or nutritional characteristics of the host. This is especially true for monophagous insects. However, many other factors may influence host choice. The present study examines host selection by Drosophila magnaquinaria, whose sole host is the yellow skunk cabbage, Lysichitum americanum. Utilization of skunk cabbage was tested relative to a set of alternative hosts. In the pre-alighting stage of host selection, skunk cabbage was found to be less attractive than tomato, cucumber, and commercial mushrooms. In pairwise oviposition tests, there were no differences among hosts. There were no differences in larval survivorship among skunk cabbage, tomato, cucumber, or Ramaria, and larvae developed into pupae earlier on tomato than on skunk cabbage. These results indicate that this monophagy is not based on characteristics of the host. We suggest that habitat selection is the more important factor in determining the association between D. magnaquinaria and skunk cabbage.", "title": ["Jack of one trade, master of none: host choice by Drosophila magnaquinaria"], "year": "1991"}

The concentration of FeO and the morphology of the oxide particles in the cast structures indicate that during solidification the process of segregation causes the oxygen potential in the interdendritic liquid to increase over that in equilibrium with the silicon content of the liquid. It appears that nuclei for the formation of the oxide phases, which probably are in the liquid prior to the onset of solidification, become surrounded by solid iron and are made ineffective. It is possible at lower silicon levels that homogeneous nucleation may result by the melt becoming sufficiently supersaturated in oxygen to form FeO or an iron-silicate liquid phase.", "title": ["Formation of silica and silicates during the solidification of Fe\u2011Si\u2011O alloys"], "year": "1970"}

{"abstract": "Summary. Positive feedback loops and double-negative feedback loops can generate bistability, allowing signaling networks to convert continuously graded inputs into discrete outputs [1-4]. One particularly well-studied bistable system consists of the mitotic regulator CDK1 with its inactivator Wee1 and its activator Cdc25 [5-7]. The system functions as a mitotic trigger, toggling between a stable interphase state, where CDK1 is off, and a stable M-phase state, where CDK1 is on. One striking aspect of the CDK1-Cdc25-Wee1 system is the symmetry of its two feedback loops (Figure 1). CDK1 phosphorylates Cdc25 at multiple sites in the protein's amino-terminal regulatory region, contributing to Cdc25 activation; CDK1 phosphorylates Wee1 at multiple sites in its amino terminus, inactivating the protein. Active Wee1 phosphorylates CDK1 at Tyr15, and thereby inactivates it; active Cdc25 dephosphorylates the same site, reversing the inactivation. In principle either loop alone could generate the bistable response observed in the CDK1-Cdc25-Wee1 system [6-8], yet, throughout evolution, both loops are invariably present. This basic design - reciprocal feedback regulation of opposing enzymes - can be seen in other regulatory switches as well [9,10]. Previous work has shown that when interlinked loops operate on different timescales, it can allow the system to quickly respond and then slowly lock into a noise-resistant state [9]. However, in the case of the CDK1-Cdc25-Wee1 system, the timescales of the two loops are indistinguishable. Here we show that a mirror-image, two-loop system offers an important advantage over a one-loop system even when the timescales of the two loops are identical: the symmetrical set-up makes it substantially easier to generate a bistable response.", "title": ["Feedback regulation of opposing enzymes generates robust, all-or-none bistable responses"], "year": "2008"}

We allow the rubble pile to partially disrupt and capture lightcurves at a specific point during the disruption at cadences comparable to those from ground-based photometry.

{"abstract": "It is customary to refer to atoms by stating positive or negative charges when they lose or gain electrons. However, thinking about the related principles and phenomena of ionization has become confusing. It is also necessary to realize that atoms of suitable elements can execute the interstate dynamics of qualified electrons. Atoms also undertake transition states. Atoms can elongate. Atoms can expand. Atoms can contract. Under a suitable input power, flowing inert gas atoms can split. Upon splitting, inert gas atoms are converted into electron streams. By carrying photons, when electron streams impinge on atoms, atoms with solid behavior further elongate. Otherwise, elongated atoms at least deform. These atomic behaviors validate that they cannot ionize. When the flowing inert gas atoms split, the characteristics of the photons become apparent. The splitting of inert gas atoms, the carrying of photons by electron streams, and the lighting of traveling photons validate that an electric current is a photonic current.

{"abstract": "A two-stage fermentation process combining hydrogen and methane production for the treatment of food waste was investigated in this paper. In hydrogen fermentation reactor, the indigenous mixed microbial cultures contained in food waste were used for hydrogen production. No foreign inoculum was used in the hydrogen fermentation stage, the traditional heat treatment of inoculum was not applied either in this bench scale experiment. The effects of the stepwise increased organic loading rate (OLR) and solid retention time (SRT) on integrated two-stage process were investigated. At steady state, the optimal OLR and SRT for the integrated two-stage process were found to be 22.65 kg VS/m 3 d (160 h) for hydrogen fermentation reactor and 4.61 (26.67 d) for methane fermentation reactor, respectively. Under the optimum conditions, the maximum yields of hydrogen (0.065 m 3 H 2/kg VS) and methane (0.546 m 3 CH 4/kg VS) were achieved with the hydrogen and methane contents ranging from 29.42 to 30.86%, 64.33 to 71.48%, respectively.

{"abstract": "Haumea is the only known trans-Neptunian object with a ring. The ring is in a position that causes a 3:1 spin-orbit resonance with the rotational period of Haumea, which has a triaxial shape. The non-axisymmetric gravitational field around Haumea is thought to affect the dynamics of the ring; however, the process of ring formation has not been elucidated. In this study, we analyze in some detail a potential ring formation scenario for Haumea. We first calculated the gravitational field around the triaxial ellipsoid and estimated the distance at which an object revolving around Haumea can exist stably using a simulation that incorporated the time-varying gravitational field. The results of this simulation showed that the trajectory of the object became unstable just inside its current ring position. Next, we analytically derived the Roche radius for a rigid body revolving around a triaxial ellipsoid and showed that the Roche radius could be near the current ring position. Furthermore, as a parameter study, we performed N-body simulations using the coefficient of rubble-pile restitution as a variable. Results demonstrated that, according to numerous parameters, the position of the Roche radius was near the current position of Haumea's ring. Based on these findings, we can assume that there is a high possibility that the ring formed in the region between the boundary of the unstable region of the orbit and the Roche radius. The scenario presented in this study could help explain the process by which Haumea's ring formed.", "title": ["N-body Simulations of the Ring Formation Process around the Dwarf Planet Haumea"], "year": "2020"}

Recently, it was shown that the JNK cascade in Xenopus oocytes exhibits sustained, all-or-none responses to graded, transient stimuli [3]. Here, we have examined the character of the JNK cascade's response in mammalian cells. The steady-state responses of JNK to sorbitol and anisomycin were found to be highly ultrasensitive in HeLa cells, HEK 293 cells, and Jurkat T cells. The JNK responses were also reversible, not sustained, as was the case in oocytes. Jurkat cells activated their JNK in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and the response of the entire population of Jurkat cells was graded. However, analysis of subpopulations of the PMA-treated Jurkat cells revealed that the steady-state responses of both JNK and CD69, a T cell surface activation marker, were essentially all-or-none in character. These studies show that the JNK cascade commonly exhibits switch-like responses to a variety of stimuli.", "title": ["The JNK Cascade as a Biochemical Switch in Mammalian Cells.

{"abstract": "Geometric confinement of a polymer chain results in a loss of conformational entropy. For a chain that can fold into a compact native state via a first-order-like transition, as is the case for many small proteins, confinement typically provides an entropic stabilization of the folded state, thereby shifting the location of the transition. This allows for the possibility of confinement (entropy) driven folding. Here, we investigate such confinement effects for a flexible square-well-sphere N-mer chain (monomer diameter \u03c3) confined within a long cylindrical pore (diameter D) or a closed cylindrical box (height H = D). We carry out Wang-Landau simulations to construct the density of states, which provides access to the complete thermodynamics of the system. For a wide pore, an entropic stabilization of the folded state is observed. However, as the pore diameter approaches the size of the folded chain (D \u223c N<SUP>1/3</SUP>\u03c3), we find a destabilization effect. For pore diameters smaller than the native ground-state, the chain folds into a different, higher energy, ground state ensemble and the T vs D phase diagram displays non-monotonic behavior as the system is forced into different ground states for different ranges of D. In this regime, isothermal reduction of the confinement dimension can induce folding, unfolding, or crystallite restructuring. For the cylindrical box, we find a monotonic stabilization effect with decreasing D. Scaling laws for the confinement free energy in the athermal limit are also investigated.", "title": ["All-or-none folding of a flexible polymer chain in cylindrical nanoconfinement"], "year": "2020"}

In a rotating frame, the periodic orbit has j' braids, $| m^{\\prime} | $ identical sectors, and $| m^{\\prime} | (j^{\\prime} -1)$ self-crossing points; (2) thus, Lindblad resonances (with j = 1) are free of self-crossing points; (3) resonances with the same j' and opposite m' have the same kinematics, and are called twins; (4) the order of a resonance at a given n/\u03a9 depends on the symmetry of the potential. A potential that is invariant under a 2\u03c0/k-rotation creates only resonances with m multiple of k; (5) resonances with the same j and opposite m have the same kinematics and same dynamics, and are called true twins; (6) A retrograde resonance (n/\u03a9 &lt; 0) is always of higher order than its prograde counterpart (n/\u03a9 &gt; 0); (7) the resonance strengths can be calculated in a compact form with the classical operators used in the case of a perturbing satellite.

{"abstract": "133P/Elst-Pizarro is the first recognized main-belt comet, but we still know little about its nucleus.

{"abstract": "Recently, several theoretical and experimental studies have been undertaken to probe the effect of stochasticity on gene expression (GE). In experiments, the GE response to an inducing signal in a cell, measured by the amount of mRNAs/proteins synthesized, is found to be either graded or binary. The latter type of response gives rise to a bimodal distribution in protein levels in an ensemble of cells. One possible origin of binary response is cellular bistability achieved through positive feedback or autoregulation. In this paper, we study a simple, stochastic model of GE and show that the origin of binary response lies exclusively in stochasticity. The transitions between the active and inactive states of the gene are random in nature. Graded and binary responses occur in the model depending on the relative stability of the activated and deactivated gene states with respect to that of mRNAs/proteins. The theoretical results on binary response provide a good description of the 'all-or-none' phenomenon observed in an eukaryotic system.", "title": ["Graded and binary responses in stochastic gene expression"], "year": "2004"}
{"abstract": "Ly\u03b1 emission is a standard tracer of starburst galaxies at high redshift. However, a number of local Ly\u03b1 emitters (LAEs) are X-ray sources, suggesting a possible origin of Ly\u03b1 photons other than young, hot stars, and which may be active at much later ages relative to the parent starburst. Resolved, nearby LAEs offer the opportunity to discriminate between diffuse X-ray emission arising from supernova-heated gas, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), or low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN). We examine archival X-ray imaging from Chandra and XMM-Newton for 11 galaxies with spatially resolved Ly\u03b1 imaging to determine the luminosity, morphology, and spectral hardness of the X-ray sources.

{"abstract": "Solar system objects with perihelia beyond the orbit of Jupiter (q &gt; 5 au) are too cold for water ice to generate an appreciable coma via sublimation. Despite this, numerous high-perihelion objects (HPOs) including many comets and recently escaped Kuiper Belt objects (Centaurs) are observed to be active out at least to the orbit of Saturn (q \u223c 10 au). Peak equilibrium temperatures at 10 au (\u223c125 K), while far too low to sublimate water ice, are sufficient to sublimate supervolatiles such as CO and CO<SUB>2</SUB> ice. Temperatures at 10 au are also high enough to trigger the rapid crystallization of exposed amorphous ice, thus constituting another possible driver of distant activity. While supervolatile ices can sublimate strongly (as ${r}_{{\\rm{H}}}^{-2} ) to at least Kuiper Belt (30 au) distances, crystallization is an exponential function of temperature that cannot be sustained much beyond \u223c10 au. The heliocentric dependence of the activity thus suggests an observational test. If activity in high-perihelion objects is triggered by crystallization, then no examples of activity should be found with perihelia of q \u226b 10 au. If, on the other hand, activity is due to free sublimation of exposed supervolatile ices, or another cause, then distant activity might be detected. We obtained sensitive, high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope observations of HPOs to search for activity beyond the crystallization zone. No examples of activity were detected in 53 objects with q &gt; 15 au, consistent with the crystallization trigger hypothesis. However, sensitivity limits are such that we cannot reject the alternative hypothesis that mass loss is driven by the sublimation of supervolatile ices.

{"abstract": "Formaldehyde (HCHO), glyoxal (GLY) and methylglyoxal (MGLY) are typical oxidation intermediates in the atmosphere, the yield of which depend on the composition of precursor NMHCs and the concentration of HOx and NOx[1]. Previous work[2-3] uses the ratio of GLY to HCHO (RGF) as an indicator of the precursor VOCs, but few people combined the ratio of GLY to MGYL (RGM), and MGLY to HCHO (RMF) together to elucidate the premature VOCs. In this work, in order to fully explore the applicability of the ratio of the three species, we applied theoretical simulation of oxidation of different NMHCs and compared the results with field observations. A box model using MCM3.3.1 is deployed for simulating different NMHCs (including isoprene, monoterpenes, aromatics, alkanes, alkenes and alkynes) degradation processes. Under the given simulation conditions, various VOCs have different \"ratio features\". For RGF, nature VOCs range from 0.04 to 0.09 and low RGF is related to isoprene degradation, high RGF is related to monoterpene oxidation; aromatics (toluene and benzene) range from 0.4 to 3; the range of alkanes is 0 - 0.003; the ratio of ethylene and acetylene is around 0.011 and 13 respectively. For RGM, nature VOCs range from 0.5 to 5; the ratio of toluene and butane is around 2.2 and 20 respectively. For RMF, nature VOCs range from 0.007 to 0.2; the ratio of toluene and butane is around 0.18 and 0 respectively. In addition, through sensitivity analysis, it is found that RGF, RGM, and RMF obtained from the oxidative degradation of various VOCs are more sensitive to the change of NO2 concentration and OH concentration. Taking isoprene as an example, the three ratios increase with the increase of OH concentration, and decrease with the decrease of NO2 concentration. The above results were then compared with the data obtained during a field observation campaign in Yangtze River Delta region. Changes of RGF, RGM, and RMF with the observed NMHCs composition were investigated, and good agreement with model simulations was found. REFERENCES [1] Kaiser J, Wolfe G M, Min K E, et al.

{"abstract": "Document-level relation extraction (RE) aims at extracting relations among entities expressed across multiple sentences, which can be viewed as a multi-label classification problem. In a typical document, most entity pairs do not express any pre-defined relation and are labeled as \"none\" or \"no relation\". For good document-level RE performance, it is crucial to distinguish such none class instances (entity pairs) from those of pre-defined classes (relations). However, most existing methods only estimate the probability of pre-defined relations independently without considering the probability of \"no relation\". This ignores the context of entity pairs and the label correlations between the none class and pre-defined classes, leading to sub-optimal predictions. To address this problem, we propose a new multi-label loss that encourages large margins of label confidence scores between each pre-defined class and the none class, which enables captured label correlations and context-dependent thresholding for label prediction. To gain further robustness against positive-negative imbalance and mislabeled data that could appear in real-world RE datasets, we propose a margin regularization and a margin shifting technique. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing multi-label losses for document-level RE and works well in other multi-label tasks such as emotion classification when none class instances are available for training.", "title": ["None Class Ranking Loss for Document-Level Relation Extraction"], "year": "2022"}
{"abstract": "Ureilites are enigmatic meteorites. Although very C-rich achondrites, they formed in the inner solar system [1] when an asteroid in the midst of differentiating was catastrophically disrupted [2]. In graphite-rich regions in the Almahata Sitta ureilite are large ( 100 \u03bcm) diamonds that formed at pressures P &gt; 2 GPa [3]. Recently, [4] identified (Fe<SUB>0.932</SUB>,Ni<SUB>0.068</SUB>)<SUB>3</SUB>(S<SUB>0.88</SUB>,P<SUB>0.12</SUB>) inclusions in these diamonds, implying formation in a metallic melt of specific composition, at P &gt; 21 GPa. They suggested the ureilite parent body (UPB) was a planet-sized body, now lost. We present an alternative hypothesis. Diamonds formed at Mars's core-mantle boundary when late-forming C-rich metallic melt met the S-rich liquid iron core, precipitating diamond, as seen in experiments [5]. Diamonds moved up through the magma ocean, partially graphitizing, leading to a diamond-bearing graphite layer in Mars's upper mantle. The Borealis basin impact ejected mantle fragments into the asteroid belt. One struck and catastrophically disrupted the UPB. Ureilite daughter bodies (UDBs) formed from mixtures of the martian impactor and the UPB. Ferroan olivines and diamond-bearing graphite in ureilites are exogenous to the UPB. Our model explains the existence and size of diamonds and the Fe/(Fe+Ni) and P/(S+P) ratios of the inclusions. We use olivine Mg#, FeO/MnO, plus O and C isotopes, to show ureilite olivine data is consistent with a UPB that underwent partial smelting, plus contributions from the uppermost crystallized martian magma ocean. Based on these insights, we identify a specific large S-type asteroid as the largest UDB and a small F-type asteroid as the parent of 2008TC3 / Almahata Sitta. We note other high-pressure components with similar origins in other meteorites. Our model allows for a 600-km Fe7C3 inner core of Mars, of relevance to the InSight mission.

{"abstract": "Many small proteins fold via a first-order ``all-or-none'' transition directly from an expanded coil to a compact native state. Here we report an analogous direct freezing transition from an expanded coil to a compact crystallite for a simple flexible homopolymer. Wang-Landau sampling is used to construct the complete density of states for square-well chains up to length 256. Analysis within both the microcanonical and canonical ensembles shows that, for a chain with sufficiently short-range interactions, the usual polymer collapse transition is preempted by a direct freezing transition. Despite the non-unique homopolymer ground state, the thermodynamics of this direct freezing transition are identical to the thermodynamics of two-state protein folding. A free energy barrier separates a high entropy ensemble of unfolded states from a low entropy set of crystallite states and the transition proceeds via the formation of a transition-state folding nucleus. An Arrhenius analysis of the folding/unfolding free energy barrier yields a Chevron plot characteristic of proteins and the model chain satisfies the van't Hoff calorimetric criterion for two-state folding.", "title": ["All-or-none protein-like folding of a homopolymer chain"], "year": "2009"}

{"abstract": "One of the many limitations with the mixed-signal design is physically testing circuit ideas. While it is easier to test digital circuits with FPGAs, this can not be done usually with mixed-signal circuits. Although some FPGAs have built-in analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters, regular commercial FPGAs development boards and low-cost FPGAs lack built-in data converters. Here we introduce an all-digital FPGA-based DAC, which is one of the main blocks to enable mixed-signal experiments. The DAC can be synthesized entirely in an FPGA and does not require the use of external components. Furthermore, and to extend its range of applications, a discussion regarding the proposed DAC's problems and possible solutions is presented. Experimental demonstration of a 4-bit and a 5-bit DAC corroborate the theoretical analysis developed in this work. This work also suggests a scheme which includes few external resistors to improve the linearity (DNL$\\leq$0.25LSB and an INL$\\leq$0.5LSB), and the power consumption (5X improvement over the standalone configuration).", "title": ["All-Digital FPGA-based DAC with None or Few External Components"], "year": "2020"}

{"abstract": "Authentication and authorization of a user's identity are generally done by the service providers or identity providers. However, these centralized systems limit the user's control of their own identity and are prone to massive data leaks due to their centralized nature. We propose a blockchain-based identity management system to authenticate and authorize users using attribute-based access control policies and privacy-preserving algorithms and finally returning the control of a user's identity to the user. Our proposed system would use a private blockchain, which would store the re-certification events and data access and authorization requests for users' identities in a secure, verifiable manner, thus ensuring the integrity of the data. This paper suggests a mechanism to digitize documents such as passports, driving licenses, electricity bills, etc., issued by any government authority or other authority in an immutable and secure manner. The data owners are responsible for authenticating and propagating the users' identities as and when needed using the OpenID Connect protocol to enable single sign-on. We use advanced cryptographic algorithms to provide pseudonyms to the users, thus ensuring their privacy. These algorithms also ensure the auditability of transactions as and when required. Our proposed system helps in mitigating some of the issues in the recent privacy debates.

{"abstract": "A warmer climate would increase the risk of floods. So far, only a few studies have projected changes in floods on a global scale. None of these studies relied on multiple climate models. A few global studies have started to estimate the exposure to flooding (population in potential inundation areas) as a proxy of risk, but none of them has estimated it in a warmer future climate. Here we present global flood risk for the end of this century based on the outputs of 11 climate models. A state-of-the-art global river routing model with an inundation scheme was employed to compute river discharge and inundation area. An ensemble of projections under a new high-concentration scenario demonstrates a large increase in flood frequency in Southeast Asia, Peninsular India, eastern Africa and the northern half of the Andes, with small uncertainty in the direction of change. In certain areas of the world, however, flood frequency is projected to decrease. Another larger ensemble of projections under four new concentration scenarios reveals that the global exposure to floods would increase depending on the degree of warming, but interannual variability of the exposure may imply the necessity of adaptation before significant warming.", "title": ["Global flood risk under climate change"], "year": "2013"}

{"abstract": "Summary. Choices of where to look are informed by perceptual judgments, which locate objects of current value or interest within the visual scene. This perceptual-motor transform is partly implemented in the frontal eye field (FEF), where visually responsive neurons appear to select behaviorally relevant visual targets and, subsequently, saccade-related neurons select the movements required to look at them. Here, we use urgent decision-making tasks to show (1) that FEF motor activity can direct accurate, visually informed choices in the complete absence of prior target-distracter discrimination by FEF visual responses and (2) that such discrimination by FEF visual cells shows an all-or-none reliance on the presence of stimulus attributes strongly associated with saliency-driven attentional allocation. The present findings suggest that FEF visual target selection is specific to visual judgments made on the basis of saliency and may not play a significant role in guiding saccadic choices informed solely by feature content.", "title": ["All-or-None Context Dependence Delineates Limits of FEF Visual Target Selection"], "year": "2019"}

{"abstract": "This paper presents an overview of air pollution transport into the Arctic. The major transport processes will be highlighted, as well as their seasonal, interannual, and spatial variability. The source regions of Arctic air pollution will be discussed, with a focus on black carbon (BC) sources, as BC can produce significant radiative forcing in the Arctic. It is found that Europe is the main source region for BC in winter, whereas boreal forest fires are the strongest source in summer, especially in years of strong burning. Two case studies of recent extreme Arctic air pollution events will be presented. In summer 2004, boreal forest fires in Alaska and Canada caused pan-Arctic enhancements of black carbon. The BC concentrations measured at Barrow (Alaska), Alert (Canada), Summit (Greenland) and Zeppelin (Spitsbergen) were all episodically elevated, as a result of the long-range transport of the biomass burning emissions. Aerosol optical depth was also episodically elevated at these stations, with an almost continuous elevation over more than a month at Summit. During the second episode in spring 2006, new records were set for all measured air pollutant species at the Zeppelin station (Spitsbergen) as well as for ozone in Iceland. At Zeppelin, BC, AOD, aerosol mass, ozone, carbon monoxide and other compounds all reached new record levels, compared to the long-term monitoring record. The episode was caused by transport of polluted air masses from Eastern Europe deep into the Arctic, a consequence of the unusual warmth in the European Arctic during the episode. While fossil fuel combustion sources certainly contributed to this episode, smoke from agricultural fires in Eastern Europe was the dominant pollution component. We also suggest a new revolatilization mechanism for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) stored in soils and vegetation by fires, as POPs were strongly elevated during both episodes. All this suggests a considerable influence of biomass burning on the pollutant concentrations in the Arctic in spring and summer, even for species that are produced exclusively by humans, such as POPs.", "title": ["Long-range transport of air pollution into the Arctic"], "year": "2007"}

Using the end-to-end package (LIGO programming language), computer codes have been made to simulate the input optics.

Wang-Landau sampling is used to construct the complete density of states for square-well chains up to length 256. Analysis within both the microcanonical and canonical ensembles shows that, for a chain with sufficiently short-range interactions, the usual polymer collapse transition is preempted by a direct freezing transition. Despite the non-unique homopolymer ground state, the thermodynamics of this direct freezing transition are identical to the thermodynamics of two-state protein folding. A free energy barrier separates a high entropy ensemble of unfolded states from a low entropy set of crystallite states and the transition proceeds via the formation of a transition-state folding nucleus. An Arrhenius analysis of the folding/unfolding free energy barrier yields a Chevron plot characteristic of proteins and the model chain satisfies the van't Hoff calorimetric criterion for two-state folding.", "title": ["All-or-none protein-like folding of a homopolymer chain"], "year": "2009"}

{"abstract": "Few-shot relation extraction aims to solve the problem of insufficient annotated data in relation extraction tasks. Through the comparison between samples, few-shot relation extraction achieves lower-cost relation classification. However, most existing methods only do classification within the scope of enumerated relations. For one of the main challenges faced by the application of few-shot relation extraction-the recognition of the none-of-the-above instances, there has been few works on it. In this paper, we propose an angular shrinkage BERT model for the few-shot relation extraction task with none-of-the-above detection, which uses an additive angular loss to enlarge the margins of different classes in the feature space, and obtain highly discriminative features to improve the recognition ability for none-of-the-above instances. Meanwhile, we present a two-stage training strategy to enhance the stability of the performance. We evaluate our model on the most used few-shot relation extraction dataset FewRel. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous sentence-pair methods in scenarios containing none-of-the-above instances, and also achieves improvements on the traditional few-shot relation extraction task compared with our baseline model.", "title": ["An angular shrinkage BERT model for few-shot relation extraction with none-of-the-above detection"], "year": "2023"}

{"abstract": "We have investigated ultrastructural changes in the integuments of larval-adult and larval-pupal intermediates produced by exogenous application of juvenile hormone (JH) analogues in Pyrrhocoris apterus (Hemiptera), and Galleria mellonella and Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera). Ultrastructural analysis of the epidermis of these intermediates always revealed the presence of only two types of epidermal cell, which produced morphologically perfect cuticles of the previous and future developmental stages. There were no intermediate cuticles at the level of individual cells. It has been determined that a single epidermal cell constitutes the lowest elementary unit in the perception and realization of the developmental messages conveyed by JH to its target tissues. Further investigations revealed that the responses of individual epidermal cells to JH were strictly autonomous and qualitative, i.e. they were executed according to the 'yes-or-no' or 'all-or-none' rule. The neighbouring epidermal cells could realize independently, side-by-side, the quite dissimilar +JH (somatic growth) or -JH (metamorphosis) developmental programmes, although each of them formed biochemically, functionally, and ontogenetically different structures. The qualitative on-and-off signal given by JH for induction of the stationary (+JH) developmental cycle was limited to relatively short, genetically determined, and stage-specific developmental periods of cellular susceptibility to JH. The mosaic mixtures of the heterochronic, larval-pupal or adult epidermal cells, which we found in different proportions on the bodies of the intermediates, revealed two variables, development-related factors: (i) the presence or absence of a minimum effective concentration of JH, and (ii) positive or negative sensitivity of a particular epidermal cell to JH.", "title": ["The All-Or-None Rule in Morphogenetic Action of Juvenile Hormone on Insect Epidermal Cells"], "year": "1997"}

We examine the differences in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurements under several environmental and geographic conditions. Results show a low bias in CALIPSO AODs especially at low optical depths (&lt;0.1). Of the 1081 total coincidences, 261 points are uncorrelated. While some of the differences are due to retrieval errors, physical reasons why most of these do not correlate include cloud contamination, scene inhomogeneity, differences in the air masses observed by the two instruments and measurement (detection) noise. Optical depth filters were used to screen out unusually low CALIPSO and unusually high AERONET AODs. The median relative bias between the two measurements is 0.24 (or 24% of the AERONET AOD) and the mean relative bias is 0.095 with a standard deviation of 0.71 when we screen out low (&lt;0.05) CALIPSO AODs and high (&gt;1.5) AERONET AODs. When filters are applied to preclude scene inhomogeneity, cloud contamination in the CALIPSO measurement, and extinction quality control flags that identify extinction retrievals with high uncertainty the median relative bias between the two measurements is 0.30 (or 30% of the AERONET AOD) and the mean relative bias is 0.35 with a standard deviation of 0.31. The studies also show that, because of the small footprint of the lidar, the AERONET-CALIPSO AOD comparisons are adversely affected by orographic formations much more than they affect AOD comparisons with large swath passive measurements. While not a direct objective of this study, we find that CALIPSO and AERONET do not agree on the cloudiness of coincident scenes in more than 45% of the coincident measurements.", "title": ["CALIPSO AERONET Aerosol Optical Depth Intercomparisons: One Size Fits None"], "year": "2011"}
{"abstract": "The mechanical vibration has always been one of the main factors that restrict the improvement of turbomachinery performance such as aero-engines. Blade vibration is one of the most important obstacle. As a non-intrusive vibration measurement method, blade tip timing (BTT) technology has the potential to replace strain gauges for blade dynamic stress monitoring. However, it still faces enormous challenges, one of which is the accuracy and reliability of the once per revolution (OPR) probe. Here, an efficient and high-precision compound reference (CR) based BTT method without OPR is proposed. The method is based on straight line fitting (SLF), and taking the blade at the midpoint of the SLF interval as the reference blade. The vibration displacement of the reference blade is obtained by the SLF of the time of arrival (ToA) of probe No. 1. Further, taking the blade as the reference, the vibration displacement of other blades is obtained. With this method, the actual blade installation angle and the probe installation angle can be measured simultaneously based on the none OPR method so as to further improving the measurement accuracy. By the numerical simulation, high speed test-rig and large scale industry turbo fan verification, the results indicate that the method has the merit of stronger anti-noise ability, less uncertainty, and much higher computational efficiency. Whereby, high-efficiency blade vibration measurement can be achieved in the whole operating speed range.", "title": ["New step to improve the accuracy of blade tip timing method without once per revolution"], "year": "2019"}

Two chimeric substrates were designed, each with two different reporter activities that were recovered after denaturation in GroES-dependent and independent fashions, respectively. The refolding of the chimeras was monitored in the presence of GroEL variants that undergo ATP-induced intraring conformational changes that are either sequential (F44W/D155A) or concerted (F44W).

{"abstract": "PROF. D. C. MILLER (``The Science of Musical Sounds,'' 1916, p. 184) admits the reality of beat-tones, but says that they are purely subjective, having no physical existence. This seems unsatisfactory. To begin with beats, it is wrong to say that it is the places of maximum intensity which are properly called beats. This is an illusion, due to too familiar diagrams. The maximum of intensity occurs at no place, but at a point of time which, at its own instant, the maximum not being absolute, is not impressive. At any point of time the next vibration of a sound may be of greater amplitude or it may not, and the listening ear, being unable to foretell, cannot tell us in the present when the maximum is attained. he perception of a maximum is bound to arrive, in fact, the day after the fair, when the sound is on the wane. On the contrary, it is the minimum of intensity which gives the effect of the beat. This is clear if the two primary tones are of equal amplitude and there is a phase of silence, when the difference of sensation is a difference, not of degree, but of kind. It has been shown that if a musical note is suddenly reduced to silence, the interruption of the series of vibrations restores the last of theseries of periodic impulses to its isolated value;, the note ends with a kind of shock or tap, comparable to one of a series of hard beats. If periodic beats are rapid enough, the final impulses at the interruptions form a fresh series, and are free to evoke in the sensorium a sensation of tone of the same frequency as the beats, a beat-tone; and this is best observed when the beats are not too violent.", "title": ["\u201cAll-or-None\u201d in the Auditory Nerve."], "year": "1920"}

Similarities and differences between the six potentials have been identified, and their transferability as well as their accuracy with respect to experiment and first-principles methods have been assessed. In general, all of these potentials do a relatively poor job of modeling the energetics of small clusters as well as the various reconstructions of the Si(111) surface. They provide a fair to good description of the properties of bulk diamond cubic silicon, its intrinsic defects, and the Si(100) surface. Besides the fact that none of them models \u03c0 bonding, their inability to be more transferable lies in their inadequate description of the angular forces. Each potential has its strengths and limitations, but none of them appears to be clearly superior to the others, and none is totally transferrable.

Optimizing the LCC-none compensation topology reduces the weight and volume of the receiver module mainly by avoiding the secondary-side resonant capacitors. In addition, high system performance similar to that of the LCC-S compensation topology is achieved. A magnetic coupler with dual power transfer channels is designed using the specific structure of the UAV. The reasonable charging zone is determined by optimizing the magnetic coupler parameters. Besides, a primary-side PI-controlled Buck converter is used to realize CC/CV charging with a high system efficiency under a suitable misalignment range to avoid the secondary-side circuit and control complexity. Finally, both simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility of the designed WCS. The total weight of the receiver coil is only 54 g.

{"abstract": "In practical applications, inductive wireless power transfer (IWPT) systems are often required to output a constant voltage or current. However, a change of the load often leads to a change of the output. This paper presents a primary side control method for an IWPT system with the series-none (SN) compensation topology. By using this method, the load, output current, and voltage can be estimated in real time by detecting the output voltage and current of the primary inverter, along with the phase difference between them. This overcomes the disadvantage where the control for a IWPT system requires wireless or wired communication between the primary side and secondary side. Phase shift voltage regulation technology and a PI controller are used to regulate the output voltage or current based on the estimated data. In order to adjust the parameters of the PI controller, a small signal model is established by the generalized state-space averaging (GSSA) method. Finally, simulations and an experimental prototype were established to verify the performance of the primary side control method. The obtained results show that the secondary parameters and variables can be accurately estimated. Under the action of the primary controller, the system can output constant voltage and current values.", "title": ["Primary side control method for constant voltage/current output of series-none compensated inductive wireless transfer systems"], "year": "2022"}
{"abstract": "Residents living adjacent to forests commonly gather non-timber forest products (NTFPs) for income, nourishment, ailment treatment, firewood, religious reasons, and artefacts. This study investigates local perceptions of the commercialisation and value addition of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in forest-adjacent communities in Ghana. NTFPs are integral to food security and cultural practices. However, more is needed to know about local perceptions of these products' commercialisation and value addition. In this study, we collected data using a qualitative research approach through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with community members involved in NTFP collection and sales. To determine which NTFPs are collected, we interviewed 732 residents about their perception of value addition to the NTFPs collected and if value addition has impacted the commercialisation and quality of the products obtained from the forest. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data for the study. From the survey, frequencies and percentages of responses were analysed for each indicator related to value addition and commercialisation of NTFPs. The study found that 97.5% of those surveyed frequently visited the forest to gather different NTFPs. For example, mushrooms, snails, honey, and others were the most collected. Also, most interviewees do not process or add value to the NTFPs collected from the forest; thus, adding value to these NTFPs could increase incomes in the future. The findings indicate that locals have a variety of perceptions and understandings about commercialisation and value-addition processes. The study emphasises the importance of understanding local perceptions to develop effective strategies for the commercialisation and value addition of NTFPs. By incorporating the perceptions and insights of locals, interventions can be tailored to meet the needs and aspirations of forest-adjacent communities and promote sustainable resource management and equitable distribution of benefits. Future research should focus on educating locals about the value addition to NTFPs, and processes for increasing the price of NTFPs by adding value and commercialising these products. Proper commercialising of NTFPs may well help improve the lives of the locals.", "title": ["Perceptions of commercialisation and value-addition of non-timber forest products in forest adjacent communities in Ghana"], "year": "2023"}

{"abstract": "In April 2007, we established an array of GPS and seismic stations on the Bering Glacier, Alaska, to investigate the relationship between glacier motion and glacier-generated seismicity. Bering Glacier is North America's largest mountain glacier and has an area of more than 5000 km2. Dual-frequency GPS data were recorded continuously at 15 second intervals at five stations on the glacier from April to September. Four of the GPS glacier stations were established in a strain diamond located roughly halfway between the equilibrium line and the terminus, at a distance of 40 km from a GPS base station located near the terminus. These four GPS glacier stations were co-located with seismometers, which, together with a fifth seismometer located at center of the strain diamond, form a cross pattern seismic array with a 4-km aperture. The fifth GPS station is located 20 km up glacier from the strain diamond and seismic array, at a point where the upper icefield feeds into a narrow gate to the lower glacier. GPS antennas were fixed to tripods constructed of steel poles drilled 5-7 m deep into the surface of the glacier. This provides a stable reference relative to the glacier surface, which is subject to several meters of annual ablation at the elevation of the strain diamond. The GPS data have been processed using the GAMIT kinematic utility Track. The motion recorded at all sites is rapid (3+ m/day) but smooth and steady down to the temporal resolution of the data. Specifically, we find no evidence for sudden motion events in the timeseries, but rather find only small perturbations superimposed on slowly varying velocities. The seismic records from short period (L-22) and broadband (6TD) instruments reveal frequent icequakes including both emergent low frequency events and impulsive high frequency events. Many of the events recorded show strong time domain correlations across the array. We will construct a timeseries of seismicty using an automatic icequake detector, allowing comparison of the GPS and seismic timeseries. The effect of alternative processing methods for the GPS data, such as GYPSY precise point positioning analysis, will also be explored.", "title": ["Continuous Measurements of Ice Motion and Associated Seismicity at Bering Glacier, Alaska."], "year": "2007"}
{"abstract": "Recent papers have documented the probability that turbidites deposited along and downslope of subduction zone accretionary prisms are likely the result of strong ground shaking from great earthquakes. Given the damaging nature of these earthquakes, along with the casualties from the associated tsunamis, the spatial and temporal patterns of these earthquakes can only be evaluated with paleoseismologic coring and seismic reflection methods. We evaluate slope stability for seafloor topography along the Sunda subduction offshore Sumatra, Indonesia. We use sediment material properties, from local (Sumatra) and analogous sites, to constrain our estimates of static slope stability Factor of Safety (FOS) analyses. We then use ground motion prediction equations (GMPE's) to estimate ground motion intensity (Arias Intensity, AI) and acceleration (Peak Ground Acceleration, PGA), as possibly generated by fault rupture, to constrain seismic loads for pseudostatic slope stability FOS analyses. The ground motions taper rapidly with distance from the fault plane, consistent with ground motion - fault distance relations measured during the 2011 Tohoku-Oki subduction zone earthquake. Our FOS analyses include a Morgenstern method of slices probabilistic analysis for 2-D profiles along with Critical Acceleration (Ac) and Newmark Displacement (Dn) analysis of multibeam bathymetry of the seafloor. In addition, we also use estimates of ground motion modeled with a 2004 Sumatra-Andaman subduction zone (SASZ) earthquake fault slip model, to also compare with our static FOS analyses of seafloor topography. All slope and trench sites are statically stable (FOS &lt; 1) and sensitive to ground motions generated by earthquakes of magnitude greater than 7. We conclude that for earthquakes of magnitude 6 to 9, PGA of 0.4-0.6 to 1.4-2.5 g would be expected, respectively, from existing GMPE's. However, saturation of accelerations in the accretionary wedge may limit actual accelerations to less than 1 g. Arias intensities of 0.4-1.7 to 7.9-33 m/s are estimated for the M = 6 and M = 9 events, respectively, are expected in the source regions of piggyback basins for local slope failures. Typical sites have Dn means of 0.1, 1.6, 7.7, and 16 cm for earthquakes of M = 6, 7, 8, and 9; suggested thresholds for displacement range between 5 and 10 cm. Thus the observed turbidite stratigraphy in the Sumatra piggyback basins can be explained by local ground motions during earthquakes with magnitude greater than ~7, given the static stability and low sedimentation rates.

{"abstract": "Summary Human activities have resulted in the decline of native crayfish and promoted the spread of invasive crayfish species in European fresh waters, threatening ecosystem structure and functioning. We compared effects of native noble crayfish (Astacus astacus), invasive signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and of the absence of crayfish on leaf litter breakdown and invertebrate prey density and biomass in stream ecosystems. In microcosm experiments, invertebrate shredder density was significantly reduced by crayfish presence but similarly affected by the two crayfish species. While crayfish did not directly influence leaf litter breakdown, their presence reduced litter decay rates through predation on invertebrate shredders (i.e. trophic cascade). These effects were again similar between native and invasive crayfish but differed among shredder prey species. Field experiments confirmed that leaf litter breakdown was significantly reduced by crayfish. Although total invertebrate density was not affected by crayfish predation, species-specific effects were observed (e.g. Limnephilidae [Trichoptera] densities were reduced in the presence of crayfish) but did not differ between native and invasive species. Our results show that crayfish can have strong, but species-specific, effects on invertebrate prey and indirect effects on leaf litter breakdown. Contrary to previous findings and popular belief, results also indicate that native noble crayfish and invasive signal crayfish have similar effects on stream communities. Hence, from a management perspective, it may be preferable to have invasive crayfish than no crayfish when impairment results in unsuitable habitats for native species.", "title": ["An invasive species may be better than none: invasive signal and native noble crayfish have similar community effects"], "year": "2014"}

{"abstract": "A flexible homopolymer chain with sufficiently short-range interactions undergoes a discontinuous transition from an expanded coil to a compact crystallite analogous to the all-or-none folding transition exhibited by fast-folding proteins. One anticipates that geometric confinement will reduce the entropy of the unfolded chain, thereby stabilizing the folded state and shifting the transition to higher temperature. In this work we study a flexible square-well N-mer chain (monomer diameter d) located between two hard walls forming a slit-like pore (width W) with the chain end-tethered to one wall. We carry out Monte simulations with Wang-Landau sampling to construct the single-chain density of states and use both microcanonical and canonical analyses to characterize phase transitions. When the slit width is similar to the size of the folded chain we observe a modest stabilization effect. Further reduction of the slit width geometrically prohibits the chain from folding into the free-chain ground state. However, a discontinuous all-or-none folding transition still occurs to a flattened crystallite that spans the pore. All-or-none folding persists even to the limit of a very narrow pore (W d) where the ground-state structure is a quasi-two-dimensional crystal. <P />Funding: NSF DMR-1204747.", "title": ["All-or-none folding of a polymer in confinement"], "year": "2016"}

In contrast, the surfaces of silicate asteroids in the main belt are significantly cooler than the Moon reducing, and possibly preventing, water formation through this combinative process. Additionally, any resulting water would likely be less stable on basaltic silicate asteroids than a comparable lunar highland surface.", "title": ["Why there is water on the Moon but apparently none on main-belt basaltic asteroids"], "year": "2011"}
{"abstract": "Quantization of weights of deep neural networks (DNN) has proven to be an effective solution for the purpose of implementing DNNs on edge devices such as mobiles, ASICs and FPGAs, because they have no sufficient resources to support computation involving millions of high precision weights and multiply-accumulate operations. This paper proposes a novel method to compress vectors of high precision weights of DNNs to ternary vectors, namely a cosine similarity based target non-retraining ternary (TNT) compression method. Our method leverages cosine similarity instead of Euclidean distances as commonly used in the literature and succeeds in reducing the size of the search space to find optimal ternary vectors from 3N to N, where N is the dimension of target vectors. As a result, the computational complexity for TNT to find theoretically optimal ternary vectors is only O(N log(N)). Moreover, our experiments show that, when we ternarize models of DNN with high precision parameters, the obtained quantized models can exhibit sufficiently high accuracy so that re-training models is not necessary.", "title": ["Neural Networks Weights Quantization: Target None-retraining Ternary (TNT)"], "year": "2019"}
{"abstract": "We analyse the effects of the Great Recession (GR) on the profitability of firms located in the main cities versus in the rest of Finland. Based on earlier literature, various regional factors could affect firms' profitability in urban areas in comparison to periphery during a major export demand shock, such as what the GR was in Finland. Yet, there are both negative and positive location specific factors in play. We use micro-data from 2005 to 2010, and employ different profitability indicators and fixed effects panel regressions. Our results indicate that firm and sector level factors affected the profitability changes the most. Regional differences seem to stem mainly from a composition of firm and sector level factors.ResumenSe analizan los efectos de la Gran Recesi\u00f3n (GR) en la rentabilidad de empresas ubicadas en las ciudades principales de Finlandia, en comparaci\u00f3n con el resto.

{"abstract": "The work presented here re-examines the long held US consensus that a tokamak reactor must operate as a steady state, rather than a pulsed, device. There are two reasons motivating this re-examination. First, current drive has proven to be more difficult to achieve than originally believed. The efficiency of the most favorable method, lower hybrid current drive, is just too low. Second, in order for pulsed devices to be able to survive cyclical stresses, earlier designs resulted in relatively large, economically unattractive reactors. Our analysis attempts to reassess these issues by making use of the game changing development of new high temperature superconductors (HTS). The ideas are as follows. Make the reactor pulsed in order to resolve the current drive problem. Make the OH transformer and toroidal field coils out of HTS, achieving maximum B = 22 T. A high toroidal field is expected to improve performance leading to a smaller reactor. Similarly, a high field OH transformer should substantially reduce the reactor size, since the same flux swing is now possible with a smaller coil radius. In addition, advanced technologies involving demountable joints and liquid blankets reduce the major component replacement down time. This allows high average power production even with shorter pulses in compact reactors limited to the same number of stress cycles as larger low field pulsed reactors. Do these ideas make pulsed reactors competitive with steady state reactors?

{"abstract": "The long-lasting after-hyperpolarization(s) (AHP) that follows the action potential in rat myotubes differentiated in culture is due to Ca2+-activated K+ channels. These channels have the property to be specifically blocked by the bee venom toxin apamin at low concentrations. Apamin has been used in this work to analyze, by electrophysiological and biochemical techniques, the role of innervation in expression of these important channels. The main results are as follows: (i) Long-lasting AHP that follows the action potential in rat myotubes in culture disappears when myotubes are cocultured with nerve cells from the spinal cord under the conditions of in vitro innervation. (ii) Extensor digitorum longus muscles from adult rats have action potentials that are not followed by AHP but AHP are systematically recorded after muscle denervation and they are blocked by apamin. (iii) Specific 125I-labeled apamin binding is undetectable in innervated muscle fibers but it becomes detectable 2-4 days after muscle denervation to be maximal 10 days after denervation. (iv) Apamin receptors detected with 125I-labeled apamin are present at fetal stages with biochemical characteristics identical to those found in myotubes in culture. The receptor number decreases as maturation proceeds and 125I-labeled apamin receptors completely disappear after the first week of postnatal life, in parallel with the disappearance of multi-innervation. All these results taken together strongly suggest an all-or-none effect of innervation on the expression of apamin-sensitive Ca2+-activated K+ channels.", "title": ["The All-Or-None Role of Innervation in Expression of Apamin Receptor and of Apamin-Sensitive Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>-activated K<SUP>+</SUP> Channel in Mammalian Skeletal Muscle"], "year": "1985"}
{"abstract": "We have conducted a five-year search of the northern sky (delta between 30 and 60 deg) for narrow-band radio signals near the 1420 MHz line of neutral hydrogen, and its second harmonic, using an 8.4 x 10 exp 6 channel Fourier spectrometer of 0.05 Hz resolution and 400 kHz instantaneous bandwidth. The observing frequency was corrected both for motions with respect to three astronomical inertial frames, and for the effect of Earth's rotation, which provides a characteristic changing Doppler signature for narrow-band signals of extraterrestrial origin.

{"abstract": "Xenopus oocyte maturation is an example of an all-or-none, irreversible cell fate induction process. In response to a submaximal concentration of the steroid hormone progesterone, a given oocyte may either mature or not mature, but it can exist in intermediate states only transiently. Moreover, once an oocyte has matured, it will remain arrested in the mature state even after the progesterone is removed. It has been hypothesized that the all-or-none character of oocyte maturation, and some aspects of the irreversibility of maturation, arise out of the bistability of the signal transduction system that triggers maturation. The bistability, in turn, is hypothesized to arise from the way the signal transducers are organized into a signaling circuit that includes positive feedback (which makes it so that the system cannot rest in intermediate states) and ultrasensitivity (which filters small stimuli out of the feedback loop, allowing the system to have a stable off-state). Here we review two simple graphical methods that are commonly used to analyze bistable systems, discuss the experimental evidence for bistability in oocyte maturation, and suggest that bistability may be a common means of producing all-or-none responses and a type of biochemical memory.", "title": ["Bistability in cell signaling: How to make continuous processes discontinuous, and reversible processes irreversible"], "year": "2001"}

{"abstract": "At perceptual threshold, some stimuli are available for conscious access whereas others are not. Such threshold inputs are useful tools for investigating the events that separate conscious awareness from unconscious stimulus processing. Here, viewing unmasked, threshold-duration images was combined with recording magnetoencephalography to quantify differences among perceptual states, ranging from no awareness to ambiguity to robust perception. A four-choice scale was used to assess awareness: \"didn't see\" (no awareness), \"couldn't identify\" (awareness without identification), \"unsure\" (awareness with low certainty identification), and \"sure\" (awareness with high certainty identification). Stimulus-evoked neuromagnetic signals were grouped according to behavioral response choices. Three main cortical responses were elicited. The earliest response, peaking at \u223c100 ms after stimulus presentation, showed no significant correlation with stimulus perception. A late response (\u223c290 ms) showed moderate correlation with stimulus awareness but could not adequately differentiate conscious access from its absence. By contrast, an intermediate response peaking at \u223c240 ms was observed only for trials in which stimuli were consciously detected. That this signal was similar for all conditions in which awareness was reported is consistent with the hypothesis that conscious visual access is relatively sharply demarcated.", "title": ["Cortical response tracking the conscious experience of threshold duration visual stimuli indicates visual perception is all or none"], "year": "2013"}

Here we develop a planar structured pressure sensor without the integrated elastic dielectric layer, and ultra-high sensitivity is achieved enabled by the emerging charge exchange channels between neighboring electrodes induced by external touching stimuli.

Potential health risk assessment was calculated using a standardized Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Total Hazard Index (THI). XRD and FTIR results revealed the clay contains varying percentage of quartz, kaolinite, anatase, halite, pyrite, goethite, smectite and palygorskite while geochemical analysis result revealed wide range of elemental concentration (ppm). Mean concentration (ppm) of Cu, Pb, Zn, Cr, Ni and Co from the markets are 5.8 \u2013 8; 17.4 \u2013 29.6; 32.4 \u2013 95.8;111.6 \u2013 103.4; 18.6 \u2013 39.4 and 4 \u2013 16.6 respectively while As was below detection limit in most of the samples.

{"abstract": "Equilibrium mechanical unfolding of a globule formed by long flexible homopolymer chain collapsed in a poor solvent and subjected to an extensional force f (force-clamp mode) or extensional deformation D (position-clamp mode) is studied theoretically. Our analysis, like all previous analysis of this problem, shows that the globule behaves essentially differently in two modes of extension. In the force-clamp mode, mechanical unfolding of the globule with increasing applied force occurs without intramolecular microphase segregation, and at certain threshold value of the pulling force the globule unfolds as a whole (\"all-or-none\" transition). The value of the threshold force and the corresponding jump in the distance between the chain ends increase with a deterioration of the solvent quality and/or with an increase in the degree of polymerization. In the position-clamp mode, the globule unfolding occurs via intramolecular microphase coexistence of globular and extended microphases followed by an abrupt unraveling transition. Reaction force in the microphase segregation regime demonstrates an \"anomalous\" decrease with increasing extension. Comparison of deformation curves in force and position-clamp modes demonstrates that at weak and strong extensions the curves for two modes coincide, differences are observed in the intermediate extension range. Another unfolding scenario is typical for short globules: in both modes of extension they unfold continuously, without jumps or intramolecular microphase coexistence, by passing a sequence of uniformly elongated configurations.", "title": ["Theory of Mechanical Unfolding of Homopolymer Globule: All-or-None Transition in Force-Clamp Mode vs Phase Coexistence in Position-Clamp Mode"], "year": "2011"}

{"abstract": "The descending plate and overriding block in a subduction zone are analogous to the guide surface and slide block in a slipper bearing, and subducted sediment is analogous to the lubricant. Subduction is more complex and varied, however, because the overriding block is not rigid, the sediment is buoyant, underplating can occur, and sediment supply can vary widely. A model based on the bearing analogy but taking these differences into account makes detailed quantitative predictions for actual sites, which are illustrated by calculations for five diverse examples: Mariana, 16\u00b0N; Mexico, 17\u00b0N; Lesser Antilles, 13\u00b0N (Barbados); Alaska, 153\u00b0W (Kodiak); and Japan, 40\u00b0N. It requires as input the geometry of the overriding block and the top of the descending plate, the distribution of density and permeability of the overriding block, the speed of subduction, the density and rheological properties of the subducted sediment, and the rate of sediment input. Its predictions include the profile of thickness of the layer of subducted sediment (all sites; maximum of 360 m at Mariana, 5300 m at Japan), the velocities of flow in the layer (all sites), the shear stresses exerted on the walls (all sites; low beneath accretionary prisms, up to 6 MPa beneath Japan), the rate of offscraping (none at Mariana and late Tertiary Mexico; 85% of input at Lesser Antilles; includes melange at Japan), the distribution and rates of underplating (none at Mariana, extensive at Japan), the zones of possible subduction erosion (extensive at Mariana; local at the others), the amount of sediment subducted to the volcanic arc (all sites; 2% of input at Lesser Antilles, 100% at Mariana), the qualitative pattern of flow at the inlet (five basic patterns; all sites), the upward flow of melange in many instances (none at Mariana; extensive at Japan), and, under relatively rare conditions, the formation of large-scale melange diapirs (only at Lesser Antilles beneath Barbados Island).", "title": ["Dynamics of sediment subduction, melange formation, and prism accretion"], "year": "1986"}

{"abstract": "Hierarchical assembly models predict a population of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. These are not resolvable by direct imaging but may be detectable via periodic variability (or nanohertz frequency gravitational waves). Following our detection of a 5.2-year periodic signal in the quasar PG 1302-102, we present a novel analysis of the optical variability of 243 500 known spectroscopically confirmed quasars using data from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) to look for close (&lt;0.1 pc) SMBH systems. Looking for a strong Keplerian periodic signal with at least 1.5 cycles over a baseline of nine years, we find a sample of 111 candidate objects. This is in conservative agreement with theoretical predictions from models of binary SMBH populations. Simulated data sets, assuming stochastic variability, also produce no equivalent candidates implying a low likelihood of spurious detections. The periodicity seen is likely attributable to either jet precession, warped accretion discs or periodic accretion associated with a close SMBH binary system. We also consider how other SMBH binary candidates in the literature appear in CRTS data and show that none of these are equivalent to the identified objects. Finally, the distribution of objects found is consistent with that expected from a gravitational-wave-driven population. This implies that circumbinary gas is present at small orbital radii and is being perturbed by the black holes. None of the sources is expected to merge within at least the next century. This study opens a new unique window to study a population of close SMBH binaries that must exist according to our current understanding of galaxy and SMBH evolution.", "title": ["A systematic search for close supermassive black hole binaries in the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey"], "year": "2015"}
{"abstract": "Using one of the largest volumes of the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation suit Magneticum, we study the evolution of protoclusters identified at redshift \u2248 4, with properties similar to the well-observed protocluster SPT2349-56. We identify 42 protoclusters in the simulation as massive and equally rich in substructures as observed, confirming that these observed structures can already be virialized. The dynamics of the internally fast-rotating member galaxies within these protoclusters resemble observations, merging rapidly to form the cores of the brightest cluster galaxies of the assembling clusters. Half of the gas reservoir of these structures is in a hot phase, with the metal enrichment at a very early stage. These systems show a good agreement with the observed amount of cold star-forming gas, largely enriched to solar values. We predict that some of the member galaxies are already quenched at z \u2248 4, rendering them undetectable through measurements of their gas reservoirs. Tracing the evolution of protoclusters reveals that none of the typical mass indicators at high redshift are good tracers to predict the present-day mass of the system. We find that none of the simulated protoclusters at z = 4.3 are among the top ten most massive clusters at redshift z = 0.2, with some barely reaching masses of M \u2248 2 \u00d7 10<SUP>14 </SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>. Although the average star formation and mass growth rates in the simulated galaxies match observations at high redshift reasonably well, the simulation fails to reproduce the extremely high total star formation rates within the observed protoclusters, indicating that the subgrid models are lacking the ability to reproduce a higher star formation efficiency (or lower depletion timescales).", "title": ["The Young and the Wild: What Happens to Protoclusters Forming at Redshift z \u2248 4?"], "year": "2023"}

{"abstract": "Chemical Equilibrium (CE) is a good example of the specific nature of chemistry. The understanding of this theme requires the conceptualization of macroscopic events, as well as explanations of sub microscopic nature, application of symbolic language and mathematics. CE is commonly identified as a topic suitable for the pedagogical use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). However, the growth in the roll of digital resources for the teaching of CE, that took place in the last decades, was not accompanied by a decrease in the signalling of students' difficulties and misconceptions in the subject. This fact, points out the relevance of clarifying the circumstances under which digital resources turn out to be useful in the teaching of CE and develop educative modules that take into account the findings and recommendations from the literature. This project aims to bring a contribution to take advantage form ICT potential in the teaching of CE. The objectives underlying the main purpose of the project were defined according to literature review, which crosses three fundamental dimensions (scientific, pedagogical and technological). The project also benefited from the previous experience of the group and the collaboration with an European project (CROSSNET). The level of abstraction necessary for the understanding of the scientific model is pointed out as the major source of difficulties in the learning of CE, while also referred as a privileged target for the intervention of ICT. In this context, we introduce the expression \"facilitating abstraction\" to summarize the idea of supporting students' abstract thinking process during the learning of formal concepts. This idea has gained importance throughout the project leading to the development of a pedagogical approach to facilitate abstraction in the learning of CE. Although based on the use of ICT, the main purpose wasn't to introduce new digital resources in the saturated field of CE. Instead, the innovation resides in applying those resources in a properly planned approach, centred in promoting 'facilitated abstraction. The research model was designed in partnership with the CROSSNET project, consisting of the conduction of a case study for gathering information on the operation of the approach in classroom context (the major advantages, difficulties associated') Based on the results, a list of recommendations was established, as well as indicators for the upgrade of the resources used. Some hypotheses for further studies were also raised. The ultimate product of the project is the pedagogical approach that we refer to as 'FACE - Facilitating Abstraction in Chemical Equilibrium (learning), available online in Portuguese/English, uploaded on educational platforms based on Web 2.0.

{"abstract": "Hurricane Katrina was one of the highest mortality disasters in US history. Typical hurricanes of the same strength take very few lives. Katrina's mortality is exceeded only by the so-called Galveston Flood (a hurricane) of 1900 that occurred at a time when forecasting was poor and evacuation was possible only by train or horse. The levee failures in New Orleans were a major contributing factor unique to Katrina. An examination of the characteristics of mortality may give insight into the cause of the great scope of the tragedy and the special vulnerability of those who died. We examine the spatial aspects of mortality. The locations of deceased victims were matched with victim information including age, race and gender for approximately 800 victims (data from Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals). From this we can analyze for spatial clustering of mortality. We know that Katrina took a particularly heavy toll on the elderly so we can analyze, for instance, whether the elderly were more likely to die in some locations than in others. Similarly, we analyze for gender and race against age (dividing age into five groups this gives 20 categories) as a factory in the geographic distribution of mortality as a way to recover measures of vulnerability. We can also correlate the spatial characteristics of mortality with underlying causes that might contribute to vulnerability. Data is available at a census block level on household income, poverty rates, education, home ownership, car ownership and a variety of other factors that can be correlated with the spatial mortality data. This allows for a multi-parameter estimation of factors that govern mortality in this unusually high mortality event.", "title": ["The geography of mortality from Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans"], "year": "2011"}
{"abstract": "The University of New Hampshire's Transforming Earth System Science Education (UNH TESSE) program is designed to enrich the Earth System Science (ESS) content knowledge and inquiry-based pedagogical skills of in-service and pre-service teachers who either currently teach or plan to teach earth science curricula.

Teachers participate in an intensive 2-week summer institute followed by an academic-year program during which they receive support from geoscience graduate fellow(s). Throughout the two-week institute, teachers receive foundational ESS content instruction and participate in field experiences that highlight different aspects of the research process. The culminating field experience provides an opportunity for the participants to conduct an investigation that is a condensed version of the full scientific research process, while modeling the pedagogical context of a k-12 classroom. Teachers participate in a full cycle of research/inquiry, often for the first time, and are also required to face many of the constraints that they will have in the classroom. Teachers work in groups of 3-4 on a self-selected research topic based on research being completed at Sallie's Fen, NH, USA, a long-term peatland research site. The investigation takes place over two days, and is comprised of, 1) faculty-presented background information on the relevant scientific concepts, the field-site, published research findings, and the instrumentation and methodologies of data collection, 2) coached development of a research question and hypothesis; 3) field-based data collection and analysis; and 4) synthesis and group presentation of findings in a 15 minute \"science talk\" format.

{"abstract": "Cottonseed provides one of the major sources of protein in the United States and in many foreign countries. The production of cottonseed is necessarily regulated by the factors which determine the demand for and production of cotton fiber. Most cottonseed meal, produced to contain 36% to 50% protein, has been used as a protein supplement for ruminant animals. Changes in processing and increased knowledge of the value of cottonseed protein have stimulated increasing use in monogastric animal feeds. Limited amounts of cottonseed protein, as a specialty item, have found acceptance domestically, and significant success has been achieved in Latin American countries in the use of high-quality cottonseed flour to relieve or prevent malnutrition in weanling children. Under current conditions and with the present state of knowledge the opportunity exists to use cottonseed protein concentrate much more extensively as a human food where protein malnutrition exists. The adequacy of both nutritional performance and consumer acceptance has been demonstrated. Still greater opportunities for expansion into human food usage appear to be available in both foreign and domestic consumption by using more sophisticated production procedures. These include the already initiated commercial production of glandless (gossypol-free) cottonseed, possible changes in types of extraction solvents, air classification and other physical processing innovations, and the production of protein isolates. Current availability of information and the nature and intensity of research studies under way support the conclusion that cottonseed protein concentrate usage will move steadily from ruminant to monogastric animal feeding and that significant amounts of this protein will be used in the human dietary in the United States and foreign countries.", "title": ["Status of cottonseed protein"], "year": "1968"}

{"abstract": "Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used for assessment in higher education. With increased use of on-line examination it is likely that the usage of MCQs will be even more in years to come. It is therefore of interest to examine some characteristics of these type of questions such as the effect of the number of distractors used and the \"None of the above\" (NOTA) or \"All of the above\" (AOTA) options. The tutor-web is an open-source, on-line drilling system that is freely available to anyone having access to the Internet. The system was designed to be used for teaching mathematics and statistics but can in principle be used for other subjects as well. The system offers thousands of multiple choice questions at high school and university level. In addition to be a tool used by students for learning it has also been used as a testbed for research on web-assisted education. The tutor-web system was used both as a learning tool and as a testing tool in a university course on mathematical statistics in the spring of 2020. Around 300 students were enrolled in the course providing tens of thousands of answers to MCQs designed to investigate the effect of the number of distractors and the use of NOTA and AOTA options in questions. The main findings of the study were that the probability of answering a question correctly was highest when a AOTA option was used as a distractor and when NOTA and AOTA were not used in questions. The probability of answering a question correctly decreased with the number of distractors.", "title": ["The effect of the number of distractors and the \"None of the above\" - \"All of the above\" options in multiple choice questions"], "year": "2021"}

{"abstract": "We present a new set of high-resolution hydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations that apply the Feedback In Realistic Environments physics to both Local Group (LG)-like and isolated Milky Way (MW)-like volumes (10 host systems in total with a baryonic particle mass \u2243 3500-7000 M_\u2299). We study the stellar mass functions, circular velocity or mass profiles, and velocity dispersions of the dwarf galaxy populations. The simulations reproduce the stellar mass function and central densities of MW satellite dwarfs for M_\\ast \u2265 10^{5.5} M_\u2299 and predict the existence of \u223c3 unidentified galaxies with M_\\ast \u223c 10^5 M_\u2299 within 300 kpc of the MW. Overall, we find no evidence for the classical missing satellites or too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problems for satellite galaxies in our sample. Among the satellites, TBTF is resolved primarily by subhalo disruption and overall mass-loss; central density profiles of subhaloes are of secondary importance. For non-satellite galaxies, our LG-like simulations predict as many as \u223c10 as-of-yet unseen galaxies at distances 0.3-1 Mpc from both hosts, with M_\\ast \u223ceq 10^{5-6} M_\u2299 (in haloes with V<SUB>max</SUB> \u223c 20 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), albeit with large halo-to-halo variance.

{"abstract": "Phototropic stimulation induces a spatial memory. This was inferred from experiments with maize (Zea mays L.) coleoptiles involving opposing blue-light pulses, separated by variable time intervals, and rotation on a horizontal clinostat (Nick and Sch\u00e4fer, 1988b, Planta 175, 380\u2013388). In those experiments, individual seedlings either curved towards the first or towards the second pulse, or they remained straight. Bending, if it occurred, seemed to be an all-or-none response. Intermediates, i.e. plants, bending only weakly, were not observed. In the first part of the present study it was attempted to create such intermediates. For this purpose the strength of the first, inducing, and the second, opposing, pulse was varied. The result was complex: (i) Individual seedlings maintained the all-or-none expression of spatial memory. (ii) However, on the level of the whole population, the time intervals at which a given response type dominated depended on the fluence ratio. (iii) Furthermore, the final curvature was determined by the fluence ratio. These results are discussed in terms of a blue-light-induced transverse polarity. This polarity initiates from a labile precursor, which can be reoriented by an opposing stimulation (indicated by the strong bending towards the second pulse). The strong curvatures towards the first pulse over long time intervals reveal that, eventually, the blue-light-induced transverse polarity becomes stabilised and thus immune to the counterpulse. In the second part of the study, the relation between phototropic transduction and transverse polarity was characterised by a phenomenological approach involving the following points: (i) Sensory adaptation for induction of transverse polarity disappears with a time course similar to that for phototropic sensory adaptataion. (ii) The fluence-response for induction of transverse polarity is a saturation curve and not bell-shaped like the curve for phototropism. (iii) For strong counterpulses and long time intervals the clinostat-elicited nastic response (Nick and Sch\u00e4fer 1989, Planta 179, 123\u2013131) becomes manifest and causes an \"aiming error\" towards the caryopsis. (iv) Temperature-sensitivity of polarity induction was high in the first 20 min after induction, then dropped sharply and rose again with the approach of polarity fixation. (v) Stimulus-summation experiments indicated that, for different inducing fluences, the actual fixation of polarity happened at about 2 h after induction. These experiments point towards an early separation of the transduction chains mediating phototropism and transverse polarity, possibly before phototropic asymmetry is formed.", "title": ["Induction of transverse polarity by blue light: An all-or-none response"], "year": "1991"}

{"abstract": "It is ultra-important to evaluate the turbine machine blade dynamic stress under abnormal conditions such as rapid rotating speed fluctuation result from surge, rub and foreign object impact. The blade tip timing (BTT) based non-contact dynamic stress measurement method is the most promising technology to replace rotating blade strain gauge. However, there are great challenges to precisely monitor the blade vibration as the rotating speed rapidly fluctuated. It limits the application of BTT considerably. Here, a novel BTT method is proposed to achieve high-precision blade vibration measurement under rapid speed fluctuation conditions. The influence of speed fluctuation on the theoretical arrival time is investigated based on the relationship between blade theoretical arrival time and installation angle. Further, using of the SG filter greatly reduces the computational complexity. The effectiveness of the method is verified by numerical simulation, academic test rig and large industrial turbo fan. The results indicate that the speed measurement error is not more than 0.6 rpm as the accelerating speed as high as 1200 rpm/s. The blade vibration displacement error caused by the rapid speed change can be less than 10 \u03bcm. Comparing with existing BTT methods, the average and standard deviation of the blade vibration measurement error are greatly reduced. The method has great value for the application of the blade health monitor and predictive maintenance in turbomachines.", "title": ["A novel method to improve the precision of BTT under rapid speed fluctuation conditions"], "year": "2022"}
{"abstract": "In this study, we present a complete and successful case study where gravity and seismic refraction surveys detect and map previously poorly known sand and clay-filled depressions within the top chalk layers in a costal context, near Dieppe, Normandy, France. This study was commissioned by local authorities after a coastal chalk cliff collapse exposed a sand and clay-filled depression which turned into a &gt; 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> landslide. This resulted in a massive clifftop retreat exceeding 40 m, which threatened infrastructure and amenities. For risk and safety assessment, coastal managers commissioned BRGM to (i) determine the depth and extent of the sand and clay-filled depression, and (ii) map the presence of similar cliff-top depressions in a 2-km-long and 400-m-wide band inland of the coast. Both geophysical methods allow the detection and mapping of the sand and clay-filled depressions, which are characterised by a co-localized deepening of the first seismic horizon and a positive gravity anomaly. Seven auger holes confirm the geophysical interpretation, with depth to the top of the chalk &gt;60 m in some instances. A map of the depth to the top of chalk is inverted using the gravity residuals. <P />The successful mapping of the previously poorly-documented sand and clay-filled depressions on the Dieppe clifftop, using both gravity and seismic refraction tomography, was used in part to generate a Coastal Landslide Hazard Zonation map, which is a useful tool for coastal managers who need to make hazard-mitigating decisions.", "title": ["Mapping sand and clay-filled depressions on a coastal chalk clifftop using gravity and seismic tomography refraction for landslide hazard assessment, in Normandy, France"], "year": "2018"}

{"abstract": "Here, we present a study of the phenomena of decayless kink oscillations in a system of active-region (AR) coronal loops. Using high-resolution observations from two different instruments, namely the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board Solar Orbiter and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we follow these AR loops for an hour each on three consecutive days. Our results show significantly more resolved decayless waves in the higher resolution EUI data compared with the AIA data. Furthermore, the same system of loops exhibits many of these decayless oscillations on Day 2, while we detect very few oscillations on Day 3 , and find none at all on Day 1. Analysis of photospheric magnetic field data reveals that, most of the time, these loops were rooted in sunspots, where supergranular flows are generally absent. This suggests that supergranular flows, which are often invoked as drivers of decayless waves, are not necessarily driving such oscillations in our observations. Similarly, our findings also cast doubt on other possible drivers of these waves, such as a transient driver or mode conversion of longitudinal waves near the loop footpoints. In conclusion, our analysis suggests that none of the commonly suspected sources proposed to drive decayless oscillations in active-region loops seem to be operating in this event, and therefore the search for that elusive wave driver needs to continue. <P />Movies associated to Figs. 1 and 2 are available at <A href=\"https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202244403/olm\">https://www.aanda.org</A>", "title": ["What drives decayless kink oscillations in active-region coronal loops on the Sun?"], "year": "2022"}

{"abstract": "We present the results of a systematic, unbiased search for subpulse modulation of 187 pulsars performed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) in the Netherlands at an observing wavelength of 21 cm. Using new observations and archival WSRT data we have increased the list of pulsars that show the drifting subpulse phenomenon by 42, indicating that at least one in three pulsars exhibits this phenomenon. The real fraction of pulsars that show the drifting phenomenon is likely to be larger than 55%. The majority of the analysed pulsars show subpulse modulation (170), of which the majority were not previously known to show subpulse modulation and 30 show clear systematic drifting. The large number of new drifters we have found allows us, for the first time, to do meaningful statistics on the drifting phenomenon. We find that the drifting phenomenon is correlated with the pulsar age such that drifting is more likely to occur in older pulsars. Pulsars that drift more coherently seem to be older and have a lower modulation index. There is no significant correlation found between P<SUB>3</SUB> and other pulsar parameters (such as the pulsar age), as has been reported in the past. There is no significant preference of drift direction and the drift direction is not found to be correlated with pulsar parameters. None of the four complexity parameters predicted by different emission models are shown to be inconsistent with the set of modulation indices of our sample of pulsars. Therefore none of the models can be ruled out based on our observations.

Here we report observations and analysis of the object 1I/2017 U1 (\u2018Oumuamua) that demonstrate its extrasolar trajectory, and that thus enable comparisons to be made between material from another planetary system and from our own. Our observations during the brief visit by the object to the inner Solar System reveal it to be asteroidal, with no hint of cometary activity despite an approach within 0.25 astronomical units of the Sun. Spectroscopic measurements show that the surface of the object is spectrally red, consistent with comets or organic-rich asteroids that reside within the Solar System. Light-curve observations indicate that the object has an extremely oblong shape, with a length about ten times its width, and a mean radius of about 102 metres assuming an albedo of 0.04. No known objects in the Solar System have such extreme dimensions. The presence of \u2018Oumuamua in the Solar System suggests that previous estimates of the number density of interstellar objects, based on the assumption that all such objects were cometary, were pessimistically low. Planned upgrades to contemporary asteroid survey instruments and improved data processing techniques are likely to result in the detection of more interstellar objects in the coming years.", "title": ["A brief visit from a red and extremely elongated interstellar asteroid"], "year": "2017"}

{"abstract": "At present, Text-to-speech (TTS) systems that are trained with high-quality transcribed speech data using end-to-end neural models can generate speech that is intelligible, natural, and closely resembles human speech. These models are trained with relatively large single-speaker professionally recorded audio, typically extracted from audiobooks. Meanwhile, due to the scarcity of freely available speech corpora of this kind, a larger gap exists in Arabic TTS research and development. Most of the existing freely available Arabic speech corpora are not suitable for TTS training as they contain multi-speaker casual speech with variations in recording conditions and quality, whereas the corpus curated for speech synthesis are generally small in size and not suitable for training state-of-the-art end-to-end models. In a move towards filling this gap in resources, we present a speech corpus for Classical Arabic Text-to-Speech (ClArTTS) to support the development of end-to-end TTS systems for Arabic. The speech is extracted from a LibriVox audiobook, which is then processed, segmented, and manually transcribed and annotated. The final ClArTTS corpus contains about 12 hours of speech from a single male speaker sampled at 40100 kHz. In this paper, we describe the process of corpus creation and provide details of corpus statistics and a comparison with existing resources. Furthermore, we develop two TTS systems based on Grad-TTS and Glow-TTS and illustrate the performance of the resulting systems via subjective and objective evaluations.

{"abstract": "Protein sequestration, where an active protein (A) is bound in an inactive complex by an inhibitor, is a common molecular mechanism in natural regulatory circuits. The inhibitor serves as a molecular sink that can buffer and titrate low concentrations of A. If sufficient protein A is produced, then the sink is saturated and A will exhibit an ultrasensitive or all-or-none response. Theory demonstrates that this ultrasensitivity grows both as a function of inhibitor concentration and increased binding affinity. Although protein sequestration can theoretically generate tunable ultrasensitive responses, this regulatory principle has never been tested experimentally. We used a synthetic genetic circuit in budding yeast to show that sequestration of a basic leucine zipper transcription factor (C/EBPa) by a dominant-negative inhibitor converts a graded transcriptional response into an ultrasensitive response, with apparent Hill coefficients up to 12. We developed a simple quantitative model for this genetic network that demonstrates how the threshold and degree of ultrasensitivity depend upon the abundance of the inhibitor, exactly as observed in our experimental results. Many proteins in natural regulatory networks involve the formation of inactive protein-protein complexes, e.g. stoichiometric inhibitors of kinases and dominant-negative inhibitors of transcription factors. Our results demonstrate that protein sequestration can provide potent and tunable ultrasensitivity in genetic networks. Ultrasensitive or all-or-none responses are critical for robust bistable or oscillatory genetic networks, and our findings suggest that protein sequestration might play an unappreciated role in facilitating the evolution of bistable or oscillatory circuits in natural systems.", "title": ["Building a genetic transistor in yeast: How protein sequestration generates a tunable ultrasensitive or all-or-none response"], "year": "2009"}

{"abstract": "Many environmental contaminants can disrupt the adaptive immune response. Exposure to the ubiquitous aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and other agonists suppresses the antibody response. The underlying pathway mechanism by which TCDD alters B cell function is not well understood. The present study investigated the mechanism of AhR-mediated pathways and mode of suppression by which TCDD perturbs terminal differentiation of B cells to plasma cells and thereby impairs antibody production. An integrated approach combining computational pathway modeling and in vitro assays with primary mouse B cells activated by lipopolysaccharide was employed. We demonstrated that suppression of the IgM response by TCDD occurs in an all-or-none (binary) rather than graded mode: i.e., it reduces the number of IgM-secreting cells in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting the IgM content in individual plasma cells. The mathematical model of the gene regulatory circuit underpinning B cell differentiation revealed that two previously identified AhR-regulated pathways, inhibition of signaling protein AP-1 and activation of transcription factor Bach2, could account for the all-or-none mode of suppression. Both pathways disrupt the operation of a bistable-switch circuit that contains transcription factors Bcl6, Prdm1, Pax5, and Bach2 and regulates B cell fate. The model further predicted that by transcriptionally activating Bach2, TCDD might delay B cell differentiation and increase the likelihood of isotype switching, thereby altering the antibody repertoire. In conclusion, the present study revealed the mode and specific pathway mechanisms by which the environmental immunosuppressant TCDD suppresses B cell differentiation.", "title": ["All-or-none suppression of B cell terminal differentiation by environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin"], "year": "2013"}

The hard contribution to the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor is about 59%, and soft contribution can be as large as 41% in the naive calculation.

{"title": ["Microstructural and Mechanical Characterization of Transition Elements-Containing Al-Si-Cu-Mg Alloys for Elevated-Temperature Applications ="], "year": "2018", "abstract": "The main objective of this study was to understand how to enhance the mechanical performance of 354-type Al-Si-Cu-Mg cast alloys at both ambient and elevated temperatures through the addition of zirconium (Zr) as a base alloying element and subsequent additions of nickel (Ni) and manganese (Mn), to validate the use of such alloys in automotive engine applications. The motive behind these additions was to develop thermally stable microstructures capable of resisting coarsening instigated by prolonged exposure at elevated temperatures and hence preserve acceptable mechanical properties of these alloys when employed in high-temperature applications. Examination of the data obtained from differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) and phase identification analyses shows that 354-type alloys developed complex as-cast microstructures containing the commonly existing phases, including alpha-Al, eutectic silicon, copper aluminide (Al2Cu) with different morphologies, Mg-rich phases such as magnesium silicide (Mg2Si), Q-phase (Al 5Cu2Mg8Si6), and Fe-based intermetallic phases including beta-Al5FeSi, alpha-Al15(Fe, Mn) 3Si2, and pi-Al8FeMg3Si6. The addition of transition elements Zr, Ni, and Mn produced other phases such as (Al,Si)3(Ti,Zr), (Al,Si)3Zr, Al9FeNi, Al3Ni, Al3CuNi, Al9FeSi3Ni 4Zr, and alpha-Al15(Fe,Mn)3Si2. Nickel proved to have a retarding effect on the kinetics of precipitation of the alpha-Al network and the eutectic Al-Si structure. Also, the presence of Ni consumed a considerable amount of Cu to form Al-Cu-Ni particles instead of Al 2Cu particles. Comparison between DSC thermograms obtained for as-cast and as-quenched alloys revealed that solution treatment at 495\u00b0C for 5 hours was sufficient to dissolve a large amount of Al2Cu particles in the alpha-Al matrix, which is mandatory for a successful aging treatment. With respect to the strengthening precipitates, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations confirmed that the investigated alloys were strengthened primarily by theta-Al2Cu and S-Al2CuMg precipitates and their precursors, in addition to a secondary strengthening effect by precipitates in the form of Alx(Zr,Ti)Si which formed following the addition of Zr. The data showed that the base alloy M1S, which is a Ni-free alloy, comprised higher fractions of theta-Al2Cu precipitates than the 4 wt.% Ni-containing alloy M4S. Additions of Ni and Mn in different amounts and combinations increased the volume fraction of intermetallic compounds in the resulting alloys M2S through M5S, compared to the base alloy (cf. 12.21% for M4S with 2.5% for M1S), producing a significant effect on the mechanical performance. The proposed additions enhanced the mechanical performance of the alloys, namely, the ambient- and elevated-temperature tensile properties, hardness values, and impact properties. For the Mn-containing alloys, the improvement in properties was attributed to the formation of sludge particles in the form of blocky alpha-Al 15(Fe,Mn)3Si2 alongside the script-like alpha-iron phase which resisted crack propagation. The precipitation of Ni-bearing phases such as Al9FeNi, Al3CuNi, and Al3Ni in the Ni-containing alloys hindered the propagation of cracks and thus improved the mechanical properties. The presence of asymmetric notches in the tensile test bars proved more deleterious than symmetric notches to the tensile properties obtained at ambient temperature and at 250\u00b0C, even if the reduced area was the same, owing to the complex state of stresses that develop at the notch root. The effects of various chemical additions on the tensile properties at ambient and high temperature were feeble in the case of notched bars compared to their obvious effects on the tensile properties of smooth (unnotched) bars. At ambient temperature, notch tensile strength (NTS) values were lower than the tensile strength values obtained for the corresponding smooth (unnotched) bars, attributed to the limited ductility of the Al-Si-Cu-Mg (354-type) cast alloys. The softening that took place during tensile testing at 250\u00b0C rendered the alloys some ductility, in particular, the M1S, M2S and M3S alloys. Consequently, the notched tensile bars with asymmetric holes for these alloys exhibited high NTS values compared to the tensile strength of unnotched bars subjected to similar treatment conditions, except for the M2S alloy in the T5-treated condition.

Several models have been proposed to explain a late impact spike, but none of them has been set within a self-consistent framework of Solar System evolution. Here we propose that the LHB was triggered by the rapid migration of the giant planets, which occurred after a long quiescent period. During this burst of migration, the planetesimal disk outside the orbits of the planets was destabilized, causing a sudden massive delivery of planetesimals to the inner Solar System. The asteroid belt was also strongly perturbed, with these objects supplying a significant fraction of the LHB impactors in accordance with recent geochemical evidence. Our model not only naturally explains the LHB, but also reproduces the observational constraints of the outer Solar System.", "title": ["Origin of the cataclysmic Late Heavy Bombardment period of the terrestrial planets"], "year": "2005"}

{"abstract": "The X-IFU instrument for X-ray observation on ESA's new ATHENA satellite will employ a complex cryogenic chain for detector cooling down to 50mK. The existence of heat peaks during the recycling stages of a 300mK cooler can compromise the stability of the entire chain; this issue can be solved by using large cryogenic liquid reservoirs or by over-dimensioning the system. However, these solutions are either costly or temporary, as cryogenic liquids will eventually run out. An Energy Storage Unit (ESU) using liquid hydrogen has been developed as a solution for absorbing 400 J of thermal energy in 30 min between 15K and 16K by taking advantage of the liquid-to-vapour latent heat of hydrogen in a closed system. The ESU is composed of a low temperature liquid hydrogen reservoir, two intermediate interfaces for gas pre-cooling and a hydrogen storage vessel at room temperature. This vessel can either be a 56-litre expansion volume (for ground testing) or a canister filled with a metal hydride, LaNi4:8Sn0:2, that chemically absorbs hydrogen in its atomic form. The latter largely reduces the volume of the vessel and enables working at near-constant pressure and temperature. Two devices have been developed for this project: a Development Model breadboard device used for preliminary testing and the Engineering Model, the final model of the ESU that is to be delivered to ESA and that was subjected to severe mechanical testing in order to comply with strict requirements. Results obtained with both models show that 400 J can be absorbed with a temperature increase of 2K when a 56-litre expansion volume is used, while results using metal hydrides show that the same heat load can be absorbed between 15K and 16:5K, where the cold cell temperature is above 16K for less than 10 min. Full regeneration of the ESU can be achieved in under 24 h without exceeding the cooling power available at the different temperature stages.

{"abstract": "Highly collimated parsec-scale jets, which are generally linked to the presence of an accretion disk, are commonly observed in low-mass young stellar objects. In the past two decades, a few of these jets have been directly (or indirectly) observed from higher-mass (larger than eight solar masses) young stellar objects, adding to the growing evidence that disk-mediated accretion also occurs in high-mass stars, the formation mechanism of which is still poorly understood. Of the observed jets from massive young stars, none is in the optical regime (massive young stars are typically highly obscured by their natal material), and none is found outside of the Milky Way. Here we report observations of HH 1177, an optical ionized jet that originates from a massive young stellar object located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The jet is highly collimated over its entire measured length of at least ten parsecs and has a bipolar geometry. The presence of a jet indicates ongoing, disk-mediated accretion and, together with the high degree of collimation, implies that this system is probably formed through a scaled-up version of the formation mechanism of low-mass stars.

{"abstract": "Evolutionary and structural models for contact binary stars make quantitative predictions about the distribution of systems in the mass ratio (q)-orbital period (P) plane. Specifically, contact binaries containing primaries with convective envelopes are predicted to be absent at mass ratios larger than a critical threshold that is a function of orbital period and total mass. We test this prediction by characterizing candidate contact binaries that appear to have mass ratios in violation of this threshold. We obtained quadrature-phase echelle spectra (R \u2248 31,000) for 18 close binaries (0.65 day &lt; P &lt; 2.00 days) in the Kepler field, from which we extracted radial velocity profiles for each system. Use of a joint Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting routine on the Kepler light curves and the radial velocity profiles allows us to retrieve all fundamental system and component parameters. Of the 18 systems, only one is a contact binary, and both components likely have radiative-not convective-envelopes. The 17 remaining systems are detached binaries (eight) or semidetached binaries (four) with ellipsoidal variations, rotating variables (four), or pulsating variables (one). Therefore, none of the systems are in violation of the theoretical mass ratio thresholds for low-mass contact binaries. The 12 noncontact binaries follow a T <SUB>2</SUB>/T <SUB>1</SUB>-q relation significantly weaker than expected for main-sequence components, suggesting radiative heating of the secondaries. Most of the secondaries have radii larger than main-sequence expectations, a possible consequence of heating.

We have combined these two types of observations to obtain in-flight calibration of the crystal spectrometer data taken over a wide range of solar activity. The Chianti spectral program was used to derive solar spectra matching the emission line distributions observed by the spectrometers and these theoretical spectra (with derived continua) were applied to the Solrad ion chamber measurements to recalculate their sensitivities for actual spectral distributions rather than for the \"gray body\" radiation used originally. The resulting absolute integrated flux values were then applied to the spectrometer observations to obtain absolute fluxes in specific emission lines. Changes in individual line fluxes between 0.8 and 2.5 nm as a function of the 2800 Mhz (F10) radio flux have also been determined and will be presented.", "title": ["The Solar Soft X-ray Irradiance and its None-flare Variability"], "year": "2003"}

The expression of this all-or-none phenotypic trait is determined by two ecophysiological response patterns: response to photoperiod and response to prey. These response patterns also vary qualitatively. Artificial selection on the reproductive phenotype significantly altered both the pattern of reproduction and the ecophysiological responses that control reproduction. In populations from western North America, the propensity for aestival reproduction is polygenically inherited, and the trait has considerable genetic variability. This variation occurs in two forms: (i) some is expressed currently and is immediately subject to natural selection (actual variation), and (ii) some is expressed in later generations and therefore is subject to natural selection only after recombination (hidden variation).

{"abstract": "This work aimed at the development of magnetic nanoparticles for antibody purification and at the evaluation of their performance in Magnetic fishing and in a newly developed hybrid technology Magnetic Aqueous Two Phase Systems. Magnetic materials were produced by coprecipitation and solvothermal approaches. Natural polymers such as dextran, extracellular polysaccharide and gum Arabic were employed for coating of iron oxide magnetic supports. Polymer coated magnetic supports were then modified with synthetic antibody specific ligands,namely boronic acid, a triazine ligand (named 22/8) and an Ugi ligand (named A2C7I1). To optimize the efficacy of magnetic nanoparticles for antibody magnetic fishing, various solutions of pure and crude antibody solutions along with BSA as a non-specific binding protein were tested. The selectivity of magnetic nanoparticle for antibody, IgG, was found effective with boronic acid and ligand 22/8. Magnetic supports were then studied for their performance in high gradient magnetic separator for effective separation capability as well as higher volume handling capability. The magnetic materials were also supplemented to aqueous two phase systems, devising a new purification technology. For this purpose, magnetic particles modified with boronic acid were more effective. This alternative strategy reduced the time of operation,maximized separation capability (yield and purity), while reducing the amount of salt required. Boronic acid coated magnetic particles bound 170 +/- 10 mg hIgG/g MP and eluted 160 +/- 5 mg hIgG/g MP, while binding only 15 +/- 5 mg BSA/g MP. The affinity constant for the interaction between hIgG and APBA_MP was estimated as 4.9 x 105 M-1 (Ka) with a theoretical maximum capacity of 492 mg hIgG adsorbed/g MP (Qmax). APBA_MPs were also tested for antibody purification directly from CHO cell supernatants.

{"abstract": "The idea of stable, localized bundles of energy has strong appeal as a model for particles. In the 1950s, John Wheeler envisioned such bundles as smooth configurations of electromagnetic energy that he called geons, but none were found. Instead, particle-like solutions were found in the late 1960s with the addition of a scalar field, and these were given the name boson stars. Since then, boson stars find use in a wide variety of models as sources of dark matter, as black hole mimickers, in simple models of binary systems, and as a tool in finding black holes in higher dimensions with only a single Killing vector.

{"abstract": "The ability of several water models to predict the properties of ices is discussed. The emphasis is put on the results for the densities and the coexistence curves between the different ice forms. It is concluded that none of the most commonly used rigid models is satisfactory. A new model specifically designed to cope with solid-phase properties is proposed. The parameters have been obtained by fitting the equation of state and selected points of the melting lines and of the coexistence lines involving different ice forms. The phase diagram is then calculated for the new potential. The predicted melting temperature of hexagonal ice (Ih) at 1bar is 272.2K. This excellent value does not imply a deterioration of the rest of the properties. In fact, the predictions for both the densities and the coexistence curves are better than for TIP4P, which previously yielded the best estimations of the ice properties.", "title": ["A potential model for the study of ices and amorphous water: TIP4P/Ice"], "year": "2005"}

We find that the radio behavior of most Type IIn supernovae may not be significantly different from that of other more normal Type II supernovae.

{"abstract": "We have obtained emission-line and continuum images of the young planetary nebula MyCn 18 with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Although from the ground MyCn 18 appeared to have a triple-ring structure similar to SN 1987A, the HST images show that MyCn 18 has an overall hourglass shape. A series of arcs appear to be etched on the walls of the hourglass near its rims. In the complex central region of the nebula we find a small, inner hourglass structure and two rings. Ring 1 is a bright elliptical ring, and ring 2 a smaller, higher excitation ring. The outer and inner hourglass, and ring 1 and ring 2, all have different centers, and none are coincident with the central star. The hourglass shape of the main nebula is consistent with the predictions of the generalized interacting-winds hypothesis for planetary nebula formation.

{"abstract": "The separate collection and treatment of urine has attracted considerable attention in the engineering community in the last few years and is seen as a viable option for enhancing the flexibility of wastewater treatment systems. This comprehensive review focuses on the status of current urine treatment processes and summarises the properties of collected urine. We distinguish between seven main purposes of urine-treatment processes: hygienisation (storage), volume reduction (evaporation, freeze-thaw, reverse osmosis), stabilisation (acidification, nitrification), P-recovery (struvite formation), N-recovery (ion-exchange, ammonia stripping, isobutylaldehyde-diurea (IBDU) precipitation), nutrient removal (anammox) and handling of micropollutants (electrodialysis, nanofiltration, ozonation). The review shows clearly that a wide range of technical options is available to treat collected urine effectively, but that none of these single options can accomplish all seven purposes. Depending on the overall goal of the treatment process, a specific technical solution or a combination of solutions can be found to meet the requirements. Such combinations are not discussed in this paper unless they are explicitly presented in the literature. Except for 'evaporation' and 'storage', none of the processes described have so far advanced beyond the laboratory stage.

{"abstract": "The association of \u03b3-ray bursts (GRBs) and core-collapse supernovae (SNe) of Type Ib and Ic was motivated by the detection of SN 1998bw in the error box of GRB 980425 and the now secure identification of SN 2003dh in the cosmological GRB 030329. The bright radio emission from SN 1998bw indicated that it possessed some of the unique attributes expected of GRBs, namely, a large reservoir of energy in (mildly) relativistic ejecta and variable energy input. The two popular scenarios for the origin of SN 1998bw are a typical cosmological burst observed off-axis or a member of a new distinct class of supernova explosions. In the former, about 0.5% of local Type Ib/c SNe are expected to be similar to SN 1998bw; for the latter no such constraint exists. Motivated thus, we began a systematic program of radio observations of most reported Type Ib/c SNe accessible to the Very Large Array. Of the 33 SNe observed from late 1999 to the end of 2002, at most one is as bright as SN 1998bw. From this we conclude that the incidence of such events is &lt;~3%. Furthermore, analysis of the radio emission indicates that none of the observed SNe exhibit clear engine signatures. Finally, a comparison of the SN radio emission to that of GRB afterglows indicates that none of the SNe could have resulted from a typical GRB, independent of the initial jet orientation. Thus, while the nature of SN 1998bw remains an open question, there appears to be a clear dichotomy between the majority of hydrodynamic and engine-driven explosions.", "title": ["A Radio Survey of Type Ib and Ic Supernovae: Searching for Engine-driven Supernovae"], "year": "2003"}

{"abstract": "Although the human disaggregase machinery has been shown to disassemble mature \u03b1-synuclein amyloid fibrils, the molecular mechanism that drives the process has remained elusive. In this work, we show that amyloid disassembly is initiated by the destabilization of the fibril ends, followed by the fast propagation of protofilament unzipping and depolymerization along the fibril axis. This mechanism results in an all-or-none disaggregation of individual aggregates, avoiding the accumulation of harmful intermediate aggregated species. We specifically show that chaperones preferentially target the most toxic \u03b1-synuclein species, namely oligomers and short fibrils. Thus, our data provide a better understanding of the chaperone-mediated disaggregation at the molecular level, a crucial step to identify potential targets for the treatment of amyloid-related neurodegenerative diseases.", "title": ["All-or-none amyloid disassembly via chaperone-triggered fibril unzipping favors clearance of \u03b1-synuclein toxic species"], "year": "2021"}

{"abstract": "Attempts to correlate values of stomatal conductance and leaf water potential with particular environmental variables in the field are generally of only limited success because they are simultaneously affected by a number of environmental variables. For example, correlations between leaf water potential and either flux of radiant energy or vapour pressure deficit show a diurnal hysteresis which leads to a scatter diagram if many values are plotted. However, a simple model may be adequate to relate leaf water potential to the flow of water through the plant. The stomatal conductance of illuminated leaves is a function of current levels of temperature, vapour pressure deficit, leaf water potential (really turgor pressure) and ambient CO_2 concentration. Consequently, when plotted against any one of these variables a scatter diagram results. Physiological knowledge of stomatal functioning is not adequate to provide a mechanistic model linking stomatal conductance to all these variables. None the less, the parameters describing the relationships with the variables can be conveniently estimated from field data by a technique of non-linear least squares, for predictive purposes and to describe variations in response from season to season and plant to plant.", "title": ["The Interpretation of the Variations in Leaf Water Potential and Stomatal Conductance Found in Canopies in the Field"], "year": "1976"}

{"abstract": "Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases are gapped short-range-entangled quantum phases with a symmetry G. They can all be smoothly connected to the same trivial product state if we break the symmetry. The Haldane phase of spin-1 chain is the first example of SPT phases which is protected by SO(3) spin rotation symmetry. The topological insulator is another example of SPT phases which are protected by U(1) and time-reversal symmetries. In this paper, we show that interacting bosonic SPT phases can be systematically described by group cohomology theory: Distinct d-dimensional bosonic SPT phases with on-site symmetry G (which may contain antiunitary time-reversal symmetry) can be labeled by the elements in H<SUP>1+d</SUP>[G,U<SUB>T</SUB>(1)], the Borel (1+d)-group-cohomology classes of G over the G module U<SUB>T</SUB>(1). Our theory, which leads to explicit ground-state wave functions and commuting projector Hamiltonians, is based on a new type of topological term that generalizes the topological \u03b8 term in continuous nonlinear \u03c3 models to lattice nonlinear \u03c3 models. The boundary excitations of the nontrivial SPT phases are described by lattice nonlinear \u03c3 models with a nonlocal Lagrangian term that generalizes the Wess-Zumino-Witten term for continuous nonlinear \u03c3 models. As a result, the symmetry G must be realized as a non-on-site symmetry for the low-energy boundary excitations, and those boundary states must be gapless or degenerate. As an application of our result, we can use H<SUP>1+d</SUP>[U(1)\u22caZ<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>T</SUP>,U<SUB>T</SUB>(1)] to obtain interacting bosonic topological insulators (protected by time reversal Z<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>T</SUP> and boson number conservation), which contain one nontrivial phase in one-dimensional (1D) or 2D and three in 3D. We also obtain interacting bosonic topological superconductors (protected by time-reversal symmetry only), in term of H<SUP>1+d</SUP>[Z<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>T</SUP>,U<SUB>T</SUB>(1)], which contain one nontrivial phase in odd spatial dimensions and none for even dimensions. Our result is much more general than the above two examples, since it is for any symmetry group. For example, we can use H<SUP>1+d</SUP>[U(1)\u00d7Z<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>T</SUP>,U<SUB>T</SUB>(1)] to construct the SPT phases of integer spin systems with time-reversal and U(1) spin rotation symmetry, which contain three nontrivial SPT phases in 1D, none in 2D, and seven in 3D. Even more generally, we find that the different bosonic symmetry breaking short-range-entangled phases are labeled by the following three mathematical objects: (G<SUB>H</SUB>,G<SUB>\u03a8</SUB>,H<SUP>1+d</SUP>[G<SUB>\u03a8</SUB>,U<SUB>T</SUB>(1)]), where G<SUB>H</SUB> is the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian and G<SUB>\u03a8</SUB> the symmetry group of the ground states.", "title": ["Symmetry protected topological orders and the group cohomology of their symmetry group"], "year": "2013"}
{"abstract": "Frequencies of 13 oscillation modes in the star XX Pyxidis (CD-24 7599) are accurately measured but for none of the modes the spherical harmonic degree (l) is known. We present results of an attempt to construct the model whose low-l mode frequencies reproduce possibly close the observations. Models are constrained by the mean photometric and spectroscopic data for the star. However, the strongest constraint on the effective temperture is from the requirement that the modes excited in the star fall into the range of the modes driven by the opacity mechanism. Our models are built with the standard stellar evolution code allowing no overshooting from the convective core. Effects of rotation are taken into account both in stellar evolution and in linear nonadiabatic oscillation calculations. Uniform rotation rate and conservation of the global angular momentum during evolution are assumed. We find several distinct mode identifications and associated stellar models leading to frequency fits of similar quality. Determination of the l values for some of the modes could remove the ambiguity. None of the fits is satifactory: the mean departures exceed the mean observational frequency error by at least one order of magnitude. The fits could be improved by means of adjusting model parameters that were kept fixed. However, such effort will be meaningful only after improving accuracy in calculation of the effects of rotation in oscillation frequencies.", "title": ["Towards a seismic model of the delta Scuti star XX Pyxidis"], "year": "1998"}
{"abstract": "We use N-body simulations combined with semianalytic models to compute the clustering properties of modeled galaxies at z~3 and confront these predictions with the clustering properties of the observed population of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). Several scenarios for the nature of LBGs are explored, which may be broadly categorized into models in which high-redshift star formation is driven by collisional starbursts and those in which quiescent star formation dominates. For each model, we make predictions for the LBG overdensity distribution, the variance of counts in cells, the correlation length, and close pair statistics. Models that assume a one-to-one relationship between massive dark matter halos and galaxies are disfavored by close pair statistics, as are models in which colliding halos are associated with galaxies in a simplified way. However, when modeling of gas consumption and star formation is included using a semianalytic treatment, the quiescent and collisional starburst models predict similar clustering properties and none of these models can be ruled out based on the available clustering data. None of the ``realistic'' models predict a strong dependence of clustering amplitude on the luminosity threshold of the sample, in apparent conflict with some observational results.", "title": ["Galaxy Formation at z~3: Constraints from Spatial Clustering"], "year": "2001"}

{"abstract": "The possible cosmological consequences of Population III stars are examined. Their dark remnants could provide the 'missing mass'. Their light could have produced either the entire 3 K background or observable distortions in its spectrum. Their heat or explosions could have reionized the universe and perhaps produced galaxies. Their helium yield could suffice to provide an alternative explanation for the observed 'primordial' abundance, and their heavy-element yield could have produced a burst of pregalactic enrichment. It is discussed which sort of stars could best fulfill these roles and conclude that the most plausible candidates would be 'Very Massive Objects' in the mass range 100-100,000 solar masses.

{"abstract": "A common assumption is that ecosystem services respond linearly to changes in habitat size.

By incorporating nonlinear wave attenuation in estimating coastal protection values of mangroves in Thailand, we show that the optimal land use option may instead be the integration of development and conservation consistent with ecosystem-based management goals.

It features a puzzling 6.67 hr periodicity and dramatic variability over a timescale of a few years. This, coupled with a young age and the lack of an obvious optical counterpart, makes 1E 1613 a unique source among all compact objects associated with SNRs. It could either be the first low-mass X-ray binary system discovered inside a SNR or a peculiar isolated magnetar with an extremely slow spin period. Analysis of archival VLT ISAAC and HST NICMOS infrared observations unveils a very crowded field. A few sources are positionally consistent with the refined X-ray error region that we derived from the analysis of 13 Chandra observations. To shed light on the nature of 1E 1613, we have performed deep IR observations of the field with the NACO instrument at the VLT, searching for variability. None of the candidates show clear modulation at 6.67 hr or have significant long-term variability. Moreover, none of the candidates stand out for peculiar colors with respect to the bulk of the field sources. We find no compelling reasons to associate any of the candidates with 1E 1613. On one hand, it is very unlikely that one of the candidates is a low-mass companion star to 1E 1613. On the other hand, if the X-ray source is an isolated magnetar surrounded by a fallback disk, we cannot exclude that the IR counterpart is hidden among the candidates.

Significantly, the related temperature of 300 K on the optimal TR rate of the case in (001) crystal face is benefit to the commercial promotion. Furthermore, feeble tensile and compressive strain can tremendously improve the TR rate for the graphite nanocones. The theoretical results of this study are conducive to the experimental design of the thermal management materials based on nano graphite of different crystal faces.", "title": ["Thermal rectification in three dimensional graphite nanocones"], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "The proliferation of technologies embedded in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) increases the potential of cyber-attacks. The communication systems between vehicles and infrastructure present remote attack access for malicious hackers to exploit system vulnerabilities. Increased connectivity combined with autonomous driving functions pose a considerable threat to the vast socioeconomic benefits promised by CAVs. However, the absence of historical information on cyber-attacks mean that traditional risk assessment methods are rendered ineffective. This paper proposes a proactive CAV cyber-risk classification model which overcomes this issue by incorporating known software vulnerabilities contained within the US National Vulnerability Database into model building and testing phases. This method uses a Bayesian Network (BN) model, premised on the variables and causal relationships derived from the Common Vulnerability Scoring Scheme (CVSS), to represent the probabilistic structure and parameterisation of CAV cyber-risk. The resulting BN model is validated with an out-of-sample test demonstrating nearly 100% prediction accuracy of the quantitative risk score and qualitative risk level. The model is then applied to the use-case of GPS systems of a CAV with and without cryptographic authentication. In the use case, we demonstrate how the model can be used to predict the effect of risk reduction measures.", "title": ["Connected and autonomous vehicles: A cyber-risk classification framework"], "year": "2019"}
{"abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have promoted the development of computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for fundus diseases, helping ophthalmologists reduce missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis rate. However, the majority of CAD systems are data-driven but lack of medical prior knowledge which can be performance-friendly. In this regard, we innovatively proposed a human-in-the-loop (HITL) CAD system by leveraging ophthalmologists' eye-tracking information, which is more efficient and accurate. Concretely, the HITL CAD system was implemented on the multiple instance learning (MIL), where eye-tracking gaze maps were beneficial to cherry-pick diagnosis-related instances. Furthermore, the dual-cross-attention MIL (DCAMIL) network was utilized to curb the adverse effects of noisy instances. Meanwhile, both sequence augmentation module and domain adversarial module were introduced to enrich and standardize instances in the training bag, respectively, thereby enhancing the robustness of our method. We conduct comparative experiments on our newly constructed datasets (namely, AMD-Gaze and DR-Gaze), respectively for the AMD and early DR detection. Rigorous experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our HITL CAD system and the superiority of the proposed DCAMIL, fully exploring the ophthalmologists' eye-tracking information. These investigations indicate that physicians' gaze maps, as medical prior knowledge, is potential to contribute to the CAD systems of clinical diseases.", "title": ["Eye tracking guided deep multiple instance learning with dual cross-attention for fundus disease detection"], "year": "2023"}
{"abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study is to reveal the mechanism of action of Yi Qi Tong Qiao Pill (YQTQP) in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR), as well as establish a paradigm for the researches on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) from systematic perspective. Methods: Based on the data collected from TCM-related and disease-related databases, target profiles of compounds in YQTQP were calculated through network-based algorithms and holistic targets of TQTQP was constructed. Network target analysis was performed to explore the potential mechanisms of YQTQP in the treatment of AR and the mechanisms were classified into different modules according to their biological functions. Besides, animal and clinical experiments were conducted to validate our findings inferred from Network target analysis. Results: Network target analysis showed that YQTQP targeted 12 main pathways or biological processes related to AR, represented by those related to IL-4, IFN-{\\gamma}, TNF-{\\alpha} and IL-13. These results could be classified into 3 biological modules, including regulation of immune and inflammation, epithelial barrier disorder and cell adhesion. Finally, a series of experiments composed of animal and clinical experiments, proved our findings and confirmed that YQTQP could improve related symptoms of AR, like permeability of nasal mucosa epithelium. Conclusion: A combination of Network target analysis and the experimental validation indicated that YQTQP was effective in the treatment of AR and might provide a new insight on revealing the mechanism of TCM against diseases.", "title": ["Network pharmacology on the mechanism of Yi Qi Tong Qiao Pill inhibiting allergic rhinitis"], "year": "2023"}

Our study examines whether people using AI to complete tasks can accurately monitor how well they perform. Participants (N = 246) used AI to solve 20 logical problems from the Law School Admission Test. While their task performance improved by three points compared to a norm population, participants overestimated their performance by four points. Interestingly, higher AI literacy was linked to less accurate self-assessment. Participants with more technical knowledge of AI were more confident but less precise in judging their own performance. Using a computational model, we explored individual differences in metacognitive accuracy and found that the Dunning-Kruger effect, usually observed in this task, ceased to exist with AI use.

We attempt to identify targets to cross-check two of the most accurate methods, megamaser, and cold molecular gas dynamics. Three promising galaxies are selected from all those with existing megamaser SMBH mass measurements. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) <SUP>12</SUP>CO (2-1) and 230-GHz continuum observations with angular resolutions of \u22480${_{.}^{\\prime\\prime}}$5. Every galaxy has an extended rotating molecular gas disc and 230-GHz continuum source(s), but all also have irregularities and/or non-axisymmetric features: NGC 1194 is highly inclined and has disturbed and lopsided central <SUP>12</SUP>CO (2-1) emission; NGC 3393 has a nuclear disc with fairly regular but patchy <SUP>12</SUP>CO (2-1) emission with little gas near the kinematic major axis, faint emission in the very centre, and two brighter structures reminiscent of a nuclear ring and/or spiral; NGC 5765B has a strong bar and very bright <SUP>12</SUP>CO (2-1) emission concentrated along two bisymmetric offset dust lanes and two bisymmetric nuclear spiral arms. <SUP>12</SUP>CO (2-1) and <SUP>12</SUP>CO (3-2) observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope are compared with the ALMA observations. Because of the disturbed gas kinematics and the impractically long integration times required for higher angular resolution observations, none of the three galaxies is suitable for a future SMBH mass measurement.

{"abstract": "Military experts often refer to space as the ultimate high ground under the premise that placing systems in orbit provides advantages consistent with the military doctrine of high ground. Although space provides the ultimate \"observation post\", it has none of the other advantages traditionally associated with high ground.

Yet systems in orbit incur none of these additional advantages. Finally, international restrictions and reciprocity concerns limit the employment of weapons in space nullifying many of the unique capability advantages that would otherwise support the \"high ground\" aspect of space. As the ultimate observation post, satellites provide a large quantity of vital data to military decision makers.

None of the annual cropping systems provided net mitigation, although soil carbon accumulation in no-till systems came closest to mitigating all other sources of GWP.

{"abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of naturally occurring dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in a river is central to estimating surface water quality, aquatic carbon cycling, and climate change. Currently, determination of DOC in surface water is primarily accomplished by manually collecting samples for laboratory analysis, which requires at least 24 hours. In other words, no effort has been devoted to monitoring real-time variations of DOC in a river due to the lack of suitable and/or cost-effective wireless sensors. However, when considering human health, carbon footprints, and effects of urbanization, industry, and agriculture on water resource supply, timely DOC information may be critical. We have developed here a new paradigm, a dynamic data driven application system (DDDAS), for estimating the real-time load of DOC into a river. This DDDAS consisted of the following four components: (1) a Visual Basic (VB) program for downloading US Geological Survey real-time chlorophyll and discharge data; (2) a STELLA model for evaluating real-time DOC load based on the relationship between chlorophyll a, DOC, and river discharge; (3) a batch file for linking the VB program and STELLA model; and (4) a Microsoft Windows Scheduled Tasks wizard for executing the model and displaying output on a computer screen at selected times. Results show that the real-time load of DOC into the St. Johns River basin near Satsuma, Putnam County, Florida, USA varied over a range from -13,143 to 29,248 kg/h at the selected site in Florida, USA. The negative loads occurred because of the back flow in the estuarine reach of the river. The cumulative load of DOC in the river for the selected site at the end of the simulation (178 hours) was about 1.2 tons. Our results support the utility of the DDDAS developed in this study for estimating the real-time variations of DOC in river ecosystems.", "title": ["Designing a Dynamic Data Driven Application System for Estimating Real-Time Load of DOC in a River"], "year": "2011"}

{"abstract": "Glaciers produce seismic energy that is detectable from local to teleseismic distances. Glaciolgical processes including calving, surface crevassing, basal sliding and other, yet unresolved source processes are capable of producing recordable seismicity. Twenty-two broadband sensors deployed in south-central Alaska during the SainT Elias TEctonics and Erosion Project (STEEP) provide an excellent means to study glacier-generated seismicity at regional distances. These instruments surround over 7500 km2 of glacier area including the Bering Glacier, Bagley Icefield and the tidewater calving glaciers of Icy Bay (Yahtse, Guyot, Tyndal). Our analysis shows that icequakes nominally occur several times hourly, and can be separated from tectonic seismicity using their unique spectral characteristics and hypocenter locations. The events typically propagate over 50-75 km distances, but occasionally are recorded at stations over 150 km away from the energy source. Hypocenters for more than 1000 events were manually calculated through a 26-day interval during October 2006, and suggest that a majority of the icequakes are associated with calving at tidewater glaciers that terminate in Icy Bay. Events with similar time and frequency domain characteristics also occur at locations away from calving fronts, but less often, and their mechanical origin remains undetermined. Automated detections from a frequency domain event detector exhibit strong correlation with the handpicked time series, and extend our analysis to all available data collected during 2006.

{"abstract": "This study explores the non-linear effect of natural resource rents and foreign direct investment (FDI) on consumption-based carbon emissions in Newly Industrialized Economies (NIEs) from 1995 to 2020. Furthermore, this study examines the interactive effect of mineral resources and FDI, coal resources, and FDI using the method of moments quantile regression (MMQR). It also apply dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS), fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), and fixed effect-ordinary least square (FE-OLS) for the robustness. The preliminary findings confirm that cross-sectional units are interdependent with slope heterogeneity and panel cointegration. The subsequent results through MMQR reflect that mineral rents and coal rents tend to increase the carbon emissions across all the quantiles (0.10<SUP>th</SUP> to 0.90<SUP>th</SUP>); however, the average change in the dependent variable is higher at higher-order quantiles (0.60<SUP>th</SUP>-0.90<SUP>th</SUP>) and lower at lower order quantiles (0.10<SUP>th</SUP> to 0.30<SUP>th</SUP>).

{"abstract": "Polimerni kompoziti, ki se uporabljajo tudi v premaznih sredstvih, estetsko spreminjajo okolje, v katerem \u017eivimo, obenem pa jih uporabljamo tudi za zascito povrsin, ki lahko propadajo zaradi skodljivih zunanjih vplivov, npr. zaradi izpostave UV svetlobi. Nove tehnoloske resitve zaradi izboljsanja funkcionalne lastnosti, kot je npr. UV zascita, se v industriji polimernih kompozitov uvajajo tudi s pomocjo nanotehnologije, v tem primeru z vgradnjo nanodelcev TiO2. Pomembno vlogo v skupini nanodelcev, ki se uporabljajo v polimernih kompozitih, predstavljajo nanodelci TiO2. Veliko raziskav je bilo usmerjenih v studij posebnih lastnosti nanodelcev TiO2, ki omogocajo doseganje posebnih funkcijskih lastnosti in transparentnosti polimernih kompozitov. Nanodelci TiO2 rutilne kristalne strukture so odlicni UV absorberji, zato se dodajajo razlicnim polimernim kompozitom za doseganje izboljsane UV in vremenske obstojnosti. Za optimalno izkoriscanje posebnih lastnosti nanodelcev v polimernih kompozitih je kljucni problem tendenca aglomeracije nanodelcev zaradi London - van der Waals - ovih interakcij v disperziji. To je mogoce prepreciti z ustrezno stabilizacijo nanodelcev v disperziji, kar zagotavlja tudi ozko porazdelitev velikosti delcev in posledicno omogoca zadostno transparentnost polimernega kompozita ter ucinkovitost UV zascite. Eden izmed nacinov stabilizacije nanodelcev TiO2 rutilne kristalne strukture v disperziji je povrsinska obdelava z anorganskimi ter organskimi snovmi. Povrsinska obdelava povrsine rutilnih TiO2 nanodelcev z anorganskimi oksidi je pomembna zaradi izboljsanja disperzbilnosti ter zmanjsanja fotokatalitske aktivnosti. Prav tako anorganski sloj na povrsini nanodelcev poveca njihovo specificno povrsino v primerjavi z neobdelanim nanodelcem. Po apliciranju anorganskega oksida na povrsini TiO2 je le ta v vodni disperziji obdelan se z organskimi reagenti - povrsinsko aktivnimi sredstvi, ki omogocajo stabilizacijo v topilu oziroma polimeru in vzpostavijo odbojne sile med posameznimi delci ter posledicno izboljsajo funkcionalno ucinkovitost sistema. Doktorski studij temelji na izvedbi dveh inovativnih sklopov dodatne povrsinske obdelave nanodelcev TiO2 rutilne kristalne strukture ter dolocitvi vpliva na aplikacijske lastnosti in UV absorpcijsko ucinkovitost polimernih nanokompozitov. V ta namen smo uporabili s koprecipitacijsko metodo sintetizirane nanodelce TiO2 rutilne kristalne strukture. Poleg klasicne stabilizacije nanodelcev TiO2 s polidimetilsiloksani smo razvili dodatna komplementarna postopka povrsinske obdelave. Z namenom izboljsanje stabilnosti nanodelcev v vodni ter polimerni disperziji smo v prvem sklopu raziskav nanodelce TiO2 dodatno povrsinsko obdelali z 3 - glicidil oksipropil trimetoksi silanom (GLYMO), v drugem pa z anorganskim oksidom beta-Fe2O3. Studirali smo vpliv razmerja TiO2/GLYMO ter procesnih pogojev priprave disperzij kot sta cas in temperatura povrsinske obdelave z GLYMO ter vpliv ut. % dodatka beta-Fe2O3 na stabilnost disperzije nanodelcev TiO2. V tretjem delu doktorske disertacije smo namesto nepravilne oblike TiO2 nanodelcev povrsinsko obdelali nanodelce TiO2 ri\u017eeve strukture. Najprej so na TiO2 nanodelce precipitirali Al2O3. Nato smo jih povrsinsko obdelali z trisilanolnimi poliedricni oligomerni silseskvioksani (POSS). Studirali smo vpliv povrsinske obdelave TiO2 nanodelcev z POSS molekulami na transparenco ter UV zascito polimernih nanokompozitov.

In the introduced-invasive control group, two species level characteristics\u2014taxon and geographic range size\u2014were significantly associated with establishment success across two biological groups. These characteristics, however, were not supported by independent data sets, or were contraindicated by these data sets, within the biological groups examined here.

Climate/habitat match is the only characteristic that is consistently significantly associated with invasive behaviour (in this case exotic range size) across biological groups. This finding, however, is not supported by two or more independent data sets within any of the biological groups examined here. Within plants there are a suite of characteristics, predominately associated with reproduction, that are significantly associated with a range of invasion metrics, predominately abundance in the invaded range. None of these characteristics, however, are supported across any other biological groups.

{"abstract": "Radio-continuum observations trace the thermal emission of ionized plasma in planetary nebulae and bring useful information regarding nebular geometries. A model of a homogeneous sphere or shell cannot fit the nebular spectra and brightness temperatures. Two alternative models have been proposed in the literature: the first consists of two homogeneous components, while the other is a model of a shell with a significant radial density gradient. On the other hand, a prolate ellipsoidal shell model can fit the surface-brightness distribution of selected objects successfully. We verify the existing models using data collected in radio surveys covering a wide range of frequencies. In about 50 per cent of cases a density gradient can be excluded and none of the remaining objects could be confirmed. None of the observed planetary nebulae shows a spectral index of 0.6 in the optically thick part of the spectrum, which is the value predicted for a shell containing a strong radial density gradient. Radio spectra can be fitted with a model of a prolate ellipsoidal shell, but also by a shell containing temperature variations in planetary nebulae. At least eight planetary nebulae show two-component spectra, with one compact component showing much higher optical thickness than the other. Unexpectedly, the group of planetary nebulae with the lowest surface brightness shows non-negligible optical thickness. Their emission comes from compact and dense structures, comprising only a small part of the total nebular mass.", "title": ["Radio observations of planetary nebulae: no evidence for strong radial density gradients"], "year": "2018"}
{"abstract": "Algorithms such as quantum factoring and quantum search illustrate the great theoretical promise of quantum computers; but the practical implementation of such devices will require careful consideration of the minimum resource requirements, together with the development of procedures to overcome inevitable residual imperfections in physical systems. Many designs have been proposed, but none allow a large quantum computer to be built in the near future. Moreover, the known protocols for constructing reliable quantum computers from unreliable components can be complicated, often requiring many operations to produce a desired transformation. Here we show how a single technique-a generalization of quantum teleportation-reduces resource requirements for quantum computers and unifies known protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that single quantum bit (qubit) operations, Bell-basis measurements and certain entangled quantum states such as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states-all of which are within the reach of current technology-are sufficient to construct a universal quantum computer. We also present systematic constructions for an infinite class of reliable quantum gates that make the design of fault-tolerant quantum computers much more straightforward and methodical.", "title": ["Demonstrating the viability of universal quantum computation using teleportation and single-qubit operations"], "year": "1999"}

{"abstract": "Objective. Synchronization in activated regions of cortical networks affect the brain\u2019s frequency response, which has been associated with a wide range of states and abilities, including memory. A non-invasive method for manipulating cortical synchronization is binaural beats. Binaural beats take advantage of the brain\u2019s response to two pure tones, delivered independently to each ear, when those tones have a small frequency mismatch. The mismatch between the tones is interpreted as a beat frequency, which may act to synchronize cortical oscillations. Neural synchrony is particularly important for working memory processes, the system controlling online organization and retention of information for successful goal-directed behavior. Therefore, manipulation of synchrony via binaural beats provides a unique window into working memory and associated connectivity of cortical networks. Approach. In this study, we examined the effects of different acoustic stimulation conditions during an N-back working memory task, and we measured participant response accuracy and cortical network topology via EEG recordings. Six acoustic stimulation conditions were used: None, Pure Tone, Classical Music, 5 Hz binaural beats, 10 Hz binaural beats, and 15 Hz binaural beats. Main results. We determined that listening to 15 Hz binaural beats during an N-Back working memory task increased the individual participant\u2019s accuracy, modulated the cortical frequency response, and changed the cortical network connection strengths during the task. Only the 15 Hz binaural beats produced significant change in relative accuracy compared to the None condition. Significance.

{"abstract": "This article reviews recent bibliography on time series of some extreme weather events and related response indicators in order to understand whether an increase in intensity and/or frequency is detectable. The most robust global changes in climate extremes are found in yearly values of heatwaves (number of days, maximum duration and cumulated heat), while global trends in heatwave intensity are not significant. Daily precipitation intensity and extreme precipitation frequency are stationary in the main part of the weather stations. Trend analysis of the time series of tropical cyclones show a substantial temporal invariance and the same is true for tornadoes in the USA. At the same time, the impact of warming on surface wind speed remains unclear. The analysis is then extended to some global response indicators of extreme meteorological events, namely natural disasters, floods, droughts, ecosystem productivity and yields of the four main crops (maize, rice, soybean and wheat). None of these response indicators show a clear positive trend of extreme events.

Here we report observations of 365 superflares, including some from slowly rotating solar-type stars, from about 83,000 stars observed over 120 days. Quasi-periodic brightness modulations observed in the solar-type stars suggest that they have much larger starspots than does the Sun. The maximum energy of the flare is not correlated with the stellar rotation period, but the data suggest that superflares occur more frequently on rapidly rotating stars.

Recently reported first proper-motion measurements for the on-plane satellites NGC 147 and NGC 185 indicate that they indeed co-orbit along the GPoA. This provides a novel opportunity to compare the M31 satellite system to \u039bCDM expectations. We perform the first detailed comparison of the orbital alignment of two satellite galaxies beyond the Milky Way with several hydrodynamical and dark-matter-only cosmological simulations (Illustris TNG50, TNG100, ELVIS, and PhatELVIS) in the context of the Planes of Satellite Galaxies Problem. In line with previous works, we find that the spatial flattening and line-of-sight velocity correlation are already in substantial tension with \u039bCDM, with none of the simulated analogs simultaneously reproducing both parameters. Almost none (3%-4%) of the simulated systems contain two satellites with orbital poles as well aligned with their satellite plane as indicated by the most likely proper motions of NGC 147 and NGC 185. However, within current measurement uncertainties, it is common (\u224870%) that the two best-aligned satellites of simulated systems are consistent with the orbital alignment. Yet, the chance that any two simulated on-plane satellites have as well-aligned orbital poles as observed is low (\u22484%).

A CD-FEM is used to characterize an FEM wafer and the results are compared with those obtained with electron microscopy.

Based on the database, we use a 11-layer CNN to learn discriminative representation and obtain state-of-theart accuracy on LFW and YTF. The publication of CASIAWebFace will attract more research groups entering this field and accelerate the development of face recognition in the wild.", "title": ["Learning Face Representation from Scratch"], "year": "2014"}
{"abstract": "The effect of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) (formerly Cretaceous-Tertiary, K-T) mass extinction on avian evolution is debated, primarily because of the poor fossil record of Late Cretaceous birds. In particular, it remains unclear whether archaic birds became extinct gradually over the course of the Cretaceous or whether they remained diverse up to the end of the Cretaceous and perished in the K-Pg mass extinction. Here, we describe a diverse avifauna from the latest Maastrichtian of western North America, which provides definitive evidence for the persistence of a range of archaic birds to within 300,000 y of the K-Pg boundary. A total of 17 species are identified, including 7 species of archaic bird, representing Enantiornithes, Ichthyornithes, Hesperornithes, and an Apsaravis-like bird. None of these groups are known to survive into the Paleogene, and their persistence into the latest Maastrichtian therefore provides strong evidence for a mass extinction of archaic birds coinciding with the Chicxulub asteroid impact. Most of the birds described here represent advanced ornithurines, showing that a major radiation of Ornithurae preceded the end of the Cretaceous, but none can be definitively referred to the Neornithes. This avifauna is the most diverse known from the Late Cretaceous, and although size disparity is lower than in modern birds, the assemblage includes both smaller forms and some of the largest volant birds known from the Mesozoic, emphasizing the degree to which avian diversification had proceeded by the end of the age of dinosaurs.", "title": ["Mass extinction of birds at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary"], "year": "2011"}
{"abstract": "All space vehicles in use today need some kind of fuel for operation. The basic physics underlying this propulsion principle severely limits the specific impulse and/or available thrust. Launch capabilities from the surface of the Earth require huge amounts of fuel. Hence, space flight, as envisaged by von Braun in the early 50s of the last century, will not be possible using this concept. Only if novel physical principles are found can these limits be overcome. Gravitational field propulsion is based on the generation of gravitational (gravity-like) fields by manmade devices. In other words, gravity-like fields should be experimentally controllable. Present physics believes that there are four fundamental interactions: strong (nuclei), weak (radioactive decay), electromagnetism and Newtonian gravitation. As experience has shown for the last six decades, none of these physical interactions is suitable as a basis for novel space propulsion. None of the advanced physical theories like string theory or quantum gravity, go beyond these four known interactions. On the contrary, recent results from causal dynamical triangulation simulations indicate that wormholes in spacetime do not seem to exist, and thus even this type of exotic space travel may well be impossible. Recently, novel physical concepts were published that might lead to advanced space propulsion technology, represented by two additional long range gravitational-like force fields that would be both attractive and repulsive, resulting from interaction of gravity with electromagnetism. A propulsion technology, based on these novel long range fields, would be working without propellant.", "title": ["Emerging Physics for Novel Field Propulsion Science"], "year": "2010"}
{"abstract": "The exchange-correlation functionals of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) are still the most used for the calculations of the geometry and electronic structure of solids. The PBE functional [J. P. Perdew , Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 3865 (1996)], the most common of them, provides excellent results in many cases. However, very recently other GGA functionals have been proposed and compete in accuracy with the PBE functional, in particular for the structure of solids. We have tested these GGA functionals, as well as the local-density approximation (LDA) and TPSS (meta-GGA approximation) functionals, on a large set of solids using an accurate implementation of the Kohn-Sham equations, namely, the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave and local orbitals method. Often these recently proposed GGA functionals lead to improvement over LDA and PBE, but unfortunately none of them can be considered as good for all investigated solids.", "title": ["Calculation of the lattice constant of solids with semilocal functionals"], "year": "2009"}

We have also analysed the photometric measurements obtained by ASAS-SN between 2019 and 2023 in the SLOAN-g band, identifying oscillations with a maximum amplitude equal to 0.188 mag. However, we find two possible periods, none producing a quality light curve.

It is found that: (1) the shape of the luminosity distribution in I or BMB is that of the bolometric luminosity function; (2) none of the available theoretical models can reproduce the SMC and LMC luminosity distribution for C stars, as M(bol) is predicted to be too bright; and (3) the observed luminosity function is approximately Gaussian, with a FWHM of about 0.8 mag in both the SMC and LMC.", "title": ["Bolometric luminosities and infrared properties of carbon stars in the Magellanic Clouds and the galaxy."], "year": "1981"}
{"abstract": "The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) experienced its most intensive and extensive coral bleaching event on record in early 1998. Mild bleaching commenced in late January and intensified by late February/early March 1998. Broad-scale aerial surveys conducted of 654 reefs (\u223c23% of reefs on the GBR) in March and April 1998, showed that 87% of inshore reefs were bleached at least to some extent (&gt;1% of coral cover) compared to 28% of offshore (mid- and outer-shelf) reefs. Of inshore reefs 67% had high levels of bleaching (&gt;10% of coral) and 25% of inshore reefs had extreme levels of bleaching (&gt;60% of coral). Fewer offshore reefs (14%) showed high levels of bleaching while none showed extreme levels of bleaching. Ground-truth surveys of 23 reefs, which experienced bleaching in intensities ranging from none to extreme, showed that the aerial survey data are likely to be underestimates of the true extent and intensity of bleaching on the GBR. The primary cause of this bleaching event is likely to be elevated sea temperature and solar radiation, exacerbated by lowered salinity on inshore and some offshore reefs in the central GBR.", "title": ["Large-scale bleaching of corals on the Great Barrier Reef"], "year": "1999"}

{"abstract": "Since the first observation of criticality in neural systems, many researchers have thought that the nervous system can operate in a critical state, and an increasing number of models equipped with different mechanisms have been proposed. We believe that there are simple mechanisms underlying the criticality in neural systems. We constructed a neural network model to investigate the mechanism underlying criticality in neural systems. We found that a neural system consisting of neurons with all-or-none dynamics and local-range dominated interaction exhibits critical behavior when properly driven. The all-or-none dynamics of single neuron and local-range dominated interaction are the identical mechanisms of criticality in the BTW sandpile model, so we concluded that whatever mechanism causes the neural system to evolve to the state where short-range dominated interaction and appropriate input is received, critical behavior can be observed.", "title": ["\"All-or-none\" dynamics and local-range dominated interaction leading to criticality in neural systems"], "year": "2024"}

{"abstract": "The Louisville \"Ridge\" is a 4300-km-long Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic hotspot chain, the South Pacific equivalent of the Hawaiian-Emperor chain. Its northwestern end is being consumed by the Tonga-Kermadec subduction zone, but Seabeam and magnetic mapping shows that the chain still includes more than 60 major volcanoes, of both normal and reversed polarity, distributed along a 75-km-wide band that can be fitted to small circles about three successive poles of Pacific plate/hotspot rotation. This band obliquely crosses fracture zones of the Eltanin system, but there is little interaction and no evidence of any genetic connection between the two structures. Forty of the Louisville volcanoes grew above sea level and are preserved as high-latitude (i.e., coral-free) guyots.

Guyot heights demonstrate that a hotspot swell several hundred meters high has persisted throughout the known life of the chain, and sometimes had an isostatic depression on its loaded crest. The depths of guyot shelf breaks increase systematically to the northwest (from 530 to 2100 m) proportional to the square root of volcano age, with some scatter and tilting caused by plate boundary tectonism and local isostatic subsidence and uplift.", "title": ["Geography and history of the Louisville Hotspot Chain in the southwest Pacific"], "year": "1988"}
{"abstract": "ACTIVE galactic nuclei (AGNs) are usually thought to be powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole (SBH)<SUP>1,2</SUP>. Their luminosities, which may exceed 10<SUP>46</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, require mass accretion rates of &gt;~=lA M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for reasonable mass-to-energy conversion efficiencies. Although this quantity of fuel could be supplied by the interstellar medium of the host galaxy, it is not obvious how it could be transported from typical galactic radii, ~10 kpc, down to the scale of the SBH, &lt;~10 pc. We propose here a mechanism, applicable to AGNs and nuclear starburst galaxies, which brings in gas from large to small scales by successive dynamical instabilities. On the large scale, a stellar bar sweeps the interstellar medium into a gaseous disk of a few hundred parsecs in radius. Under certain conditions, this disk can become unstable again, allowing material to flow inwards until turbulent viscous processes control angular-momentum transport. This flow pattern may feed viscosity-driven accretion flows around a SBH, or lead to the formation of a SBH if none was present initially.", "title": ["Bars within bars: a mechanism for fuelling active galactic nuclei"], "year": "1989"}
{"abstract": "Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations, or LFQPOs, are ubiquitous in black hole X-ray binaries and provide strong constraints on the accretion-ejection processes. Although several models have been proposed, none has been proven to reproduce all observational constraints, and no consensus has emerged so far. We make the conjecture that disks in binaries are threaded by a large-scale vertical magnetic field that splits it into two radial zones. In the inner jet-emitting disk (JED), a near equipartition field allows driving powerful self-collimated jets, while beyond a transition radius, the disk magnetization is too low and a standard accretion disk (SAD) is settled. In a series of papers, this hybrid JED-SAD disk configuration has been shown to successfully reproduce most multiwavelength (radio and X-rays) observations, as well as the concurrence with the LFQPOs for the archetypal source GX 339-4. We first analyze the main QPO scenarios provided in the literature: (1) a specific process occurring at the transition radius, (2) the accretion-ejection instability, and (3) the solid-body Lense-Thirring disk precession. We recall their main assumptions and shed light on some severe theoretical issues that question the capability of reproducing LFQPOs. We then argue that none of these models can be operating under JED-SAD physical conditions. We finally propose an alternative scenario according to which LFQPOs are the disk response to an instability triggered in the jets near a magnetic recollimation zone. This situation can account for most of the type C QPO phenomenology and is consistent with the global behavior of black hole binaries. This nondestructive jet instability remains to be calculated, however. If this instability is numerically confirmed, then it might also naturally account for the jet wobbling phenomenology seen in various accreting sources such as compact objets and young forming stars.", "title": ["Are low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in accretion flows the disk response to jet instability?"], "year": "2022"}
{"abstract": "The direct detection of a stellar system that explodes as a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) has not yet been successful. Various indirect methods have been used to investigate SN Ia progenitor systems but none have produced conclusive results. A prediction of single-degenerate models is that H- (or He-) rich material from the envelope of the companion star should be swept up by the SN ejecta in the explosion. Seven SNe Ia have been analysed to date looking for signs of H-rich material in their late-time spectra and none were detected. We present results from new late-time spectra of 11 SNe Ia obtained at the Very Large Telescope using XShooter and FORS2. We present the tentative detection of H\u03b1 emission for SN 2013ct, corresponding to \u223c0.007 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> of stripped/ablated companion star material (under the assumptions of the spectral modelling). This mass is significantly lower than expected for single-degenerate scenarios, suggesting that &gt;0.1 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> of H-rich is present but not observed. We do not detect H\u03b1 emission in the other 10 SNe Ia. This brings the total sample of normal SNe Ia with non-detections (&lt;0.001-0.058 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) of H-rich material to 17 events. The simplest explanation for these non-detections is that these objects did not result from the explosion of a CO white dwarf accreting matter from a H-rich companion star via Roche lobe overflow or symbiotic channels. However, further spectral modelling is needed to confirm this. We also find no evidence of He-emission features, but models with He-rich companion stars are not available to place mass limits.", "title": ["Searching for swept-up hydrogen and helium in the late-time spectra of 11 nearby Type Ia supernovae"], "year": "2016"}
{"abstract": "Isotopic data from exceptionally well preserved foraminifera show that the subtropical North Atlantic had sea surface temperatures (SSTs) between 30 and 31 \u00b0C during the late Albian and early Cenomanian. These temperatures were warmer than average modern temperatures in the tropical western Atlantic and support previous inferences based on diagenetically suspect material of Albian tropical SSTs of \u223c30 \u00b0C. This finding is consistent with basic theories of oceanic thermal response in the tropics to the high atmospheric carbon dioxide levels during the middle-Cretaceous greenhouse. However, our data do not support the concept of a super-Tethyan region of hypersaline waters in the western North Atlantic during late Albian and early Cenomanian time, because seawater salinities substantially higher than modern ones would require significantly higher SSTs than those reported here. Isotopic analysis of mid-Cretaceous planktic foraminifera shows that Planomalina&lt;/em&gt;, Ticinella&lt;/em&gt;, and Biticinella&lt;/em&gt; grew in surface waters and provide isotopic proxies for SST, whereas deeper growing species include Hedbergella&lt;/em&gt;, Rotalipora&lt;/em&gt;, and Praeglobotruncana&lt;/em&gt;. None of these taxa display isotopic indications of photosymbiosis, suggesting that this ecology did not evolve in planktic foraminifera before the Late Cretaceous. Contrary to previous hypotheses, none of these species increased their depth habitat during their life cycles, unlike many extant planktic foraminifera. The rotaliporids may have been preferentially susceptible to extinction during oceanic anoxic events because they lived within or below the thermocline for most of their life cycles.", "title": ["Low-latitude sea-surface temperatures for the mid-Cretaceous and the evolution of planktic foraminifera"], "year": "1998"}
{"abstract": "We have conducted an N-band survey of 14 young stars in the ~30 Myr old Tucana-Horologium association to search for evidence of warm, circumstellar dust disks.

The experimental results show that this process gives rise to the observation of vibrational spectra for molecules contained in the junction region. The phenomena have been studied for a number of molecular species and at temperatures ranging from 1 to 300\u00b0K. The principal effect of temperature is to broaden the observed spectral lines which can be accounted for quantitatively by considering the thermal smearing of the electron distribution in metals. Two detailed interaction mechanisms are discussed which can give rise to infrared dipole or Raman selection rules. None of the experiments carried out thus far can distinguish between these two processes, because of the low symmetry of the molecules used.

{"abstract": "There is observational evidence that supports the existence of very massive stars (VMS) in the local universe. First, VMS (M<SUB>ini</SUB> \u2272 320 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) have been observed in the Large Magellanic Clouds (LMC). Secondly, there are observed supernovae (SNe) that bear the characteristics of pair creation supernovae (PCSNe, also referred to as pair instability SN) which have VMS as progenitors. The most promising candidate to date is SN 2007bi. In order to investigate the evolution and fate of nearby VMS, we calculated a new grid of models for such objects, for solar, LMC and Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC) metallicities, which covers the initial mass range from 120 to 500 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. Both rotating and non-rotating models were calculated using the GENEVA stellar evolution code and evolved until at least the end of helium burning and for most models until oxygen burning. Since VMS have very large convective cores during the main-sequence phase, their evolution is not so much affected by rotational mixing, but more by mass loss through stellar winds. Their evolution is never far from a homogeneous evolution even without rotational mixing. All the VMS, at all the metallicities studied here, end their life as WC(WO)-type Wolf-Rayet stars. Because of very important mass losses through stellar winds, these stars may have luminosities during the advanced phases of their evolution similar to stars with initial masses between 60 and 120 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. A distinctive feature which may be used to disentangle Wolf-Rayet stars originating from VMS from those originating from lower initial masses would be the enhanced abundances of Ne and Mg at the surface of WC stars. This feature is however not always apparent depending on the history of mass loss. At solar metallicity, none of our models is expected to explode as a PCSN. At the metallicity of the LMC, only stars more massive than 300 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> are expected to explode as PCSNe. At the SMC metallicity, the mass range for the PCSN progenitors is much larger and comprises stars with initial masses between about 100 and 290 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. All VMS in the metallicity range studied here produce either a Type Ib SN or a Type Ic SN but not a Type II SN. We estimate that the progenitor of SN 2007bi, assuming a SMC metallicity, had an initial mass between 160 and 175 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>.

{"abstract": "The angular momentum of light can be described by positions on a higher-order Poincar\u00e9 sphere, where superpositions of spin and orbital angular momentum states give rise to laser beams that have many applications, from microscopy to materials processing. Many techniques exist to create such beams but none so far allow their creation at the source. Here we report on a new class of laser that is able to generate all states on the higher-order Poincar\u00e9 sphere. We exploit geometric phase control inside a laser cavity to map polarization to orbital angular momentum, demonstrating that the orbital angular momentum degeneracy of a standard laser cavity may be broken, producing pure orbital angular momentum beams, and that generalized vector vortex beams may be created with high purity at the source. This work paves the way to new lasers for structured light based on intracavity geometric phase control.", "title": ["Controlled generation of higher-order Poincar\u00e9 sphere beams from a laser"], "year": "2016"}
{"abstract": "Very energetic astrophysical events are required to accelerate cosmic rays to above 10<SUP>18</SUP> electronvolts. GRBs (\u03b3-ray bursts) have been proposed as possible candidate sources. In the GRB `fireball' model, cosmic-ray acceleration should be accompanied by neutrinos produced in the decay of charged pions created in interactions between the high-energy cosmic-ray protons and \u03b3-rays. Previous searches for such neutrinos found none, but the constraints were weak because the sensitivity was at best approximately equal to the predicted flux. Here we report an upper limit on the flux of energetic neutrinos associated with GRBs that is at least a factor of 3.7 below the predictions. This implies either that GRBs are not the only sources of cosmic rays with energies exceeding 10<SUP>18</SUP> electronvolts or that the efficiency of neutrino production is much lower than has been predicted.", "title": ["An absence of neutrinos associated with cosmic-ray acceleration in \u03b3-ray bursts"], "year": "2012"}
{"abstract": "Using a combination of ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we have constructed a catalog of 179 supernova remnants (SNRs) and SNR candidates in the nearby spiral galaxy M51. Follow-up spectroscopy of 66 of the candidates confirms that 61 of these are SNRs and suggests that the vast majority of the unobserved objects are SNRs as well. A total of 55 of the candidates are coincident with (mostly soft) X-ray sources identified in deep Chandra observations of M51; searching the positions of other soft X-ray sources resulted in several additional possible optical candidates. There are 16 objects in the catalog coincident with known radio sources. None of the sources with spectra show the high velocities (\u2273500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) characteristic of young, ejecta-dominated SNRs like Cas A; instead, most if not all appear to be middle-aged SNRs. The general properties of the SNRs, size distribution and spectral characteristics, resemble those in other nearby spiral galaxies, notably M33, M83, and NGC 6946, where similar samples exist. However, the spectroscopically observed [N II]:H\u03b1 ratios appear to be significantly higher than in any of these other galaxies. Although we have explored various ideas to explain the high ratios in M51, none of the explanations appear to be satisfactory. * Based in part on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Incorporated, under NASA contract NAS5-26555.

{"abstract": "Floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) has been widely used for the growth of various carbon nanotube (CNT) macrostructures, mainly including vertically aligned CNT (VACNT) arrays and none-woven CNT films. However, it is still unclear for the reason why these CNT macrostructures with largely different morphologies were received via the similar method. In this research, it revealed that the growth temperature largely affected the nucleation status of floating catalysts and thus controlled the morphologies of CNT macrostructures from VACNT arrays to none-woven CNT films. In low temperatures (below 800 \u00b0C), VACNTs were grown by bottom-up mechanism with several CNTs, but not one individual from bottom to up along the array height direction. Furthermore, VACNT arrays were only grown on some substrates that can induce iron atoms aggregating to catalyst particles with a suitable size. When increasing the growth temperature higher than 800 \u00b0C, more catalyst particles were nucleated in the gas flow, which induced the formation of none-woven CNT films composed of thin CNTs (single-walled CNTs and double-walled CNTs). This research was significative for understanding CNT growth mechanism via FCCVD process and the synthesis of different CNT macrostructures by this strategy.", "title": ["Rational control on floating catalysts for the growth of carbon nanotube assemblies: From vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays to carbon nanotube films"], "year": "2015"}
{"abstract": "Evidence is presented to show that for a squid axon membrane the potential response, V, is a smoothly continuous function of a stimulating current, I. This makes it unlikely that an all-or-none or sharp transition phenomenon is a major factor in the processes by which ions cross the normal squid axon membrane and, probably, other excitable membranes. Spatially uniform V and I were first produced in the squid axon with internal and external electrode arrangements and later by isolating a short length of axon between external pools of sucrose. Under these simplified conditions, direct experiments and calculations based on the Hodgkin-Huxley empirical conductances agree in showing that the maximum response, R, is a continuous, single-valued function of the effect of the stimulus, S. The maximum value of \u0394R/\u0394S decreased steadily as the temperatures were increased from 25\u00b0 to 38\u00b0C. Uncontrolled fluctuations prevented direct observations of \u0394R/\u0394S below 15\u00b0C where calculations showed that it rose rapidly as the temperature decreased. Since the conductances are experimental parameters and since \u0394R/\u0394S as calculated from them remained finite and continuous event at 6.3\u00b0C, this is experimental evidence against an all-or-none threshold excitation. However there is an all-or-none threshold for the initiation and propagation of an impulse along an axon where V and I are functions of both time and distance.", "title": ["Nerve Membrane Excitation without Threshold"], "year": "1970"}
{"abstract": "Geographical data plays a major role in urban plan development, both as a planning instrument and as a normative document that legally defines public obligations and binds individuals, in a given period of time, regarding the urban aspect of a city or an urban conglomerate, and establishes standards for land use and land cover. The plan is associated with a process, called the planning process, which consists in a set of dynamic and adaptive phases that begin with its development and end with the evaluation of any discrepancies between the provisions of the original document and the accomplished goals and objectives. The plan, the process, and the planning praxis require up-to-date geographical data at all times, both for monitoring actions and for the evaluation phases. One of the crucial aspects of the plan is the quantification of the existing building volume. Another fundamental aspect is managing that volume: both regarding the existing volume and any additional volumes. Actually, the building volume in built areas has been one of the most sensitive topics on the densification of existing urban spaces or the design of new growing urban areas. Considering the existing theoretical framework, the central topic of this thesis focuses on 3D point cloud modelling obtained from LiDAR and UAV technologies, employed in the development of a plan and in the urban planning process, namely regarding two specific building parameters--building height and volume. The explanation of the central topic of this thesis is twofold: implementation and usability. The implementation level has two goals: i) demonstrating the relevance and pertinence of the extraction, measurement, and 3D geovisualization of building parameters based on the experimentation and implementation of geoprocessing techniques; ii) demonstrating the pertinence of the extracted building parameters considering different urban morphologies. At the usability level, we defined two goals: i) demonstrating the usability of the extracted building parameters, evaluating the error associated with the extraction; ii) demonstrating the usability of these parameters for planning, particularly for high precision dasymetric mapping. Based on our research, we propose a methodological solution termed. 3D Extraction Building Parameters (3DEBP) and aimed at extracting areas, facade height, and building volumes from 3D point clouds. This solution was created with the following set of FOSS tools: PostgreSQL/PostGIS, GRASS, QGIS, and R-stats. We performed several tests in two urban areas with different morphologies: Praia de Faro (irregular morphology) and Amadora (regular morphology). The former (Praia de Faro) used a LiDAR point cloud and another one extracted from a UAV survey, while the latter (urban neighbourhood of Amadora) only used a UAV point cloud. Both experiments reveal that the quality of the information extracted depends on urban morphology. Finally, we discuss 3D measurement based on data obtained from LiDAR and UAV technology, raising questions on the implementation of FOSS solutions for different phases of the planning process, and arguing for the intensive introduction of 3D modelling for the future of urban planning.

{"abstract": "The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. Light from the centers of many AGN is obscrued by optically thick circumstellar matter, particularly at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. In radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit radio through gamma-ray light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation anistropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise to different classes through different orientations. This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which includes radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and general properties of AGN. We summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission caused by circumstellar obscuration and relativistic beaming. We outline the two most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking the high-luminosity sources (BL Lac objects and less luminous radio galaxies). Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available data. We analyze the possible connections between low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN and conclude they probably are powered by similar physical processes, at least within the relativistic jet. We review potential difficulties with unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become available. We conclude with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this field.

{"abstract": "Quantile mapping methods are commonly used to correct climatic variables biases, application that has significantly grown with the need to bias correct General Circulation Models (GCMs) outputs. However, bias correction of GCM outputs has shown to significantly depend on several factors, such as the location of its implementation, climatic variable involved, and the adopted method. The standard quantile mapping (QM) performs well in removing biases in historical mean and standard deviation, but the method has shown to distort raw GCM changes, incorporating unwanted biases. As an alternative, more sophisticated quantile mapping methods have been developed to correct climatic variable biases, while also preserving raw GCM changes. Examples of these methods are detrended quantile mapping (DQM), quantile delta mapping (QDM), scaled distribution mapping (SDM) and unbiased quantile mapping (UQM). Although these more sophisticated quantile mapping methods have shown to outperform the QM method, QM is still widely used because of its simplicity. Thus, there is the need for comprehensive coding packages that implement and compare this wide range of quantile mapping methods. Currently, most of the quantile mapping codes are developed in R, followed by Python, while a few are developed in MATLAB. None of the typical packages implement more than three of the quantile mapping previously mentioned, and only one package was developed in more than one language, one being a newer version of the other. Additionally, none of the existing packages has a tool to assess the performance of the different methods, which is a key aspect for the user or decision maker to identify the most appropriate method for each situation. For this purpose, we developed a package called climQMBC (climatic variables Quantile Mapping Bias Correction), written in R, Python and MATLAB, which performs the five bias correction methods mentioned above and generates a report that allows users to compare their performance. The comparison is based on the capability of correcting biases and preserving raw GCM changes. This package is an easy-to-use tool that will facilitate the obtention of local climatic projections and the analysis of different alternatives to do so.", "title": ["ClimQMBC a new Package to Bias Correct Climatic Variables While Preserving raw GCM Changes in the Mean and Standard Deviation for R, Python and MATLAB"], "year": "2021"}

{"abstract": "A vessel containing a heavy liquid vibrates vertically with constant frequency and amplitude. It has been observed that for some combinations of frequency and amplitude standing waves are formed at the free surface of the liquid, while for other combinations the free surface remains plane. In this paper the stability of the plane free surface is investigated theoretically when the vessel is a vertical cylinder with a horizontal base, and the liquid is an ideal frictionless fluid making a constant angle of contact of 90 degrees with the walls of the vessel. When the cross-section of the cylinder and the frequency and amplitude of vibration of the vessel are prescribed, the theory predicts that the mth mode will be excited when the corresponding pair of parameters (p<SUB>m</SUB>, q<SUB>m</SUB>) lies in an unstable region of the stability chart; the surface is stable if none of the modes is excited. (The corresponding frequencies are also shown on the chart.) The theory explains the disagreement between the experiments of Faraday and Rayleigh on the one hand, and of Matthiessen on the other. An experiment was made to check the application of the theory to a real fluid (water). The agreement was satisfactory; the small discrepancy is ascribed to wetting effects for which no theoretical estimate could be given.", "title": ["The Stability of the Plane Free Surface of a Liquid in Vertical Periodic Motion"], "year": "1954"}

Existing finite difference schemes in regular and staggered grid systems are checked for violations of the conservation requirements and a few important discrepancies are pointed out. In particular, it is found that none of the existing higher order schemes for a staggered mesh system simultaneously conserve mass, momentum, and kinetic energy. This deficiency is corrected through the derivation of a general family of fully conservative higher order accurate finite difference schemes for staggered grid systems. Finite difference schemes in a collocated grid system are also analyzed, and a violation of kinetic energy conservation is revealed. The predicted conservation properties are demonstrated numerically in simulations of inviscid white noise, performed in a two-dimensional periodic domain.

Here we show that a dark halo tilted in the same direction as the stellar halo can induce a warp and flare in the Galactic disk at the same amplitude and orientation as the data. In our model, the warp is visible in both the gas and stars of all ages, which is consistent with the breadth of observational tracers of the warp.

Being based on local updates only, our method nevertheless allows one to work with the grand canonical ensemble and nonzero winding numbers, and to calculate any dynamical correlation function as easily as expectation values of, e.g., total energy.

{"abstract": "Debris discs represent the last stages of planet formation and as such are expected to be depleted of primordial gas. None the less, in the last few years the presence of cold gas has been reported in ~20 debris discs from far-infrared to (sub-)mm observations and hot gas has been observed in the optical spectra of debris discs for decades. While the origin of this gas is still uncertain, most pieces of evidence point towards a secondary origin, as a result of collisions and evaporation of small bodies in the disc. In this paper, we present ALMA observations aimed at the detection of CO gas in a sample of eight debris discs with optical gas detections. We report the detection of CO (<SUP>12</SUP>CO and <SUP>13</SUP>CO) gas in HD 36546, the brightest and youngest disc in our sample, and provide upper limits to the presence of gas in the remaining seven discs.", "title": ["The search for gas in debris discs: ALMA detection of CO gas in HD 36546"], "year": "2022"}

Growth rate, particulate organic carbon content, and particulate inorganic carbon content were measured, and organic and inorganic carbon production calculated. The four strains did not show a uniform response to carbonate chemistry changes in any of the analysed parameters and none of the four strains displayed a response pattern previously described for this species.

Therefore, our study provides new, model-independent insights into the recently proposed nontrivial relations between generalized and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions.

Some of them were proved to orbit each other thanks to their eclipse-timing-variations (ETVs) of both pairs, hence they really constitute rare quadruples with two eclipsing pairs. Some of them do not, as we are still waiting for more data to detect their mutual movement. Their light curves and period changes were analysed. All of them are detached and near-contact, but none of them contact; moreover, to our knowledge none of these stars can be considered as blend of two spatially unresolved close components on the sky. These systems are CzeV2647 (0.5723296 + 0.9637074 days), proved to orbit with 4.5-year periodicity; CzeV1645 (1.0944877 + 1.6594641 days), with a rather questionable detection of ETV; CzeV3436 (0.6836870 + 0.3833930 days); and, finally, OGLE SMC-ECL-1758 (0.9291925 + 3.7350826 days), proved to move on its 30-year orbit. Even more surprising is the fact that most of these systems show the ratio of their two orbital periods close to coupling near some resonant values of small integers, namely CzeV2647, with only 1% from 3:5 resonance, CzeV1645 1% from 2:3 resonance, and OGLE SMC-ECL-1758 with only 0.49% from 1:4 resonance.

{"abstract": "The paper presents a study of the observations and theory which are relevant to the presently popular belief that the solar-flare phenomenon is a direct consequence of the annihilation of magnetic fields on the sun. There is very little in the observations to support such views. A systematic study of the known theoretical mechanisms for the diffusion, reconnection, and annihilation of magnetic fields is presented. The mechanisms discussed are Joule dissipation, ambipolar diffusion, and various forms of Sweet's mechanism. It is shown that Sweet's mechanism is much more effective in a highly compressible medium if the merging magnetic fields are exacily antiparallel. None of the known mechanisms are sufficiently rapid to account for the solar flare from the annihilation of magnetic fields. Errors and omissions in earlier discussions of the problem are cited. Since no possible energy source other than magnetic fields has yet been developed, the question of field annihilation remains both open and pressing. The possibilities of runaway electrons and hydrodynamic instability, as means for hastening magneticfield annihilation, are considered. It is shown that there is no reason to expect runaway electrons and no effective instability unless the fields are exactly antiparallel. The observational and theoretical difficulties with the hypothesis of magnetic-field annihilation suggest that other alternatives for the flare must be explored.", "title": ["The Solar-Flare Phenomenon and the Theory of Reconnection and Annihiliation of Magnetic Fields."], "year": "1963"}
{"abstract": "While once rare, observations of stars being tidally disrupted by supermassive black holes are quickly becoming commonplace. To continue to learn from these events, it is necessary to robustly and systematically compare our growing number of observations with theory. We present a tidal disruption module for the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFiT) and the results from fitting 14 tidal disruption events (TDEs). Our model uses FLASH simulations of TDEs to generate bolometric luminosities and passes these luminosities through viscosity and reprocessing transformation functions to create multiwavelength light curves. It then uses an MCMC fitting routine to compare these theoretical light curves with observations. We find that none of the events show evidence for viscous delays exceeding a few days, supporting the theory that our current observing strategies in the optical/UV are missing a significant number of viscously delayed flares. We find that the events have black hole masses of 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> and that the masses we predict are as reliable as those based on bulk galaxy properties.

Specifically, KOIs-268.01 and 3220.01 pass none of the tests and KOIs-303.01, 1888.01, and 1925.01 pass a single test each. Only KOI-2728.01 satisfies two, but fails the cross-validation test for predictions. Further, detailed photodynamical modeling reveals that KOI-2728.01 favors a negative-radius moon (as does KOI-268.01). We also note that we find a significant photoeccentric effect for KOI-1925.01 indicating an eccentric orbit of at least e &gt; (0.62 \u00b1 0.06). For comparison, we applied the same tests to Kepler-1625b, which reveals that (1) and (3) are passed, but (2) cannot be checked with the cross-validation method used here, due to the limited number of available epochs. In conclusion, we find no compelling evidence for exomoons among the six KOIs. Despite this, we were able to derive exomoon mass upper limits versus semimajor axis, with KOI-3220.01 leading to particularly impressive constraints of M<SUB>S</SUB>/M<SUB>P</SUB> &lt; 0.4% [2\u03c3] at a similar semimajor to that of the Earth-Moon.", "title": ["An Independent Analysis of the Six Recently Claimed Exomoon Candidates"], "year": "2020"}
{"abstract": "We report the results of calculations of the lattice mode spectra of ices II, VIII, and IX, designed to test the accuracy of several water-water potentials. The potentials which give the best (but not accurate) descriptions of the lattice structures, densities, and energies of these ices are found to give the proper overall description of the distribution of their lattice vibrations and the changes in frequency induced by isotopic substitution. Just as none of the available potentials gives accurate predictions of the lattice densities and energies, none gives a quantitative description of the lattice spectra of these ices. Nevertheless, there are some features of the calculations for the several water-water potentials which are robust and likely correct for the real systems. The most important of these predictions is that there is relatively little translation-libration coupling in the proton ordered ices.", "title": ["Calculations of the lattice mode spectra of proton ordered ices: A test of the accuracy of water-water potentials"], "year": "1984"}
{"abstract": "With the overwhelming success in the field of quantum information in the last decades, the \"quest\" for a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) model began in order to combine quantum computing with the striking properties of neural computing. This article presents a systematic approach to QNN research, which so far consists of a conglomeration of ideas and proposals. It outlines the challenge of combining the nonlinear, dissipative dynamics of neural computing and the linear, unitary dynamics of quantum computing. It establishes requirements for a meaningful QNN and reviews existing literature against these requirements. It is found that none of the proposals for a potential QNN model fully exploits both the advantages of quantum physics and computing in neural networks. An outlook on possible ways forward is given, emphasizing the idea of Open Quantum Neural Networks based on dissipative quantum computing.", "title": ["The quest for a Quantum Neural Network"], "year": "2014"}
{"abstract": "We present calculations of the lattice thermal conductivity of silicon that incorporate several commonly used empirical models of the interatomic potential. Second- and third-order force constants obtained from these potentials are used as inputs to an exact iterative solution of the inelastic phonon Boltzmann equation, which includes the anharmonic three-phonon scattering as well as isotopic defect and boundary scattering. Comparison of the calculated lattice thermal conductivity with the experiment shows that none of these potentials provides satisfactory agreement. Calculations of the mode Gr\u00fcneisen parameters and the linear thermal expansion coefficient help elucidate the reasons for this. We also examine a set of parameters for one of these empirical potentials that produces improved agreement with both the measured lattice thermal conductivity and the thermal expansion data.", "title": ["Lattice thermal conductivity of silicon from empirical interatomic potentials"], "year": "2005"}
{"abstract": "Rotational spin-up due to outgassing of comet nuclei has been identified as a possible mechanism for considerable mass-loss and splitting. We report a search for spin changes for three large Jupiter-family comets (JFCs): 14P/Wolf, 143P/Kowal-Mrkos, and 162P/Siding Spring. None of the three comets has detectable period changes, and we set conservative upper limits of 4.2 (14P), 6.6 (143P), and 25 (162P) min per orbit. Comparing these results with all eight other JFCs with measured rotational changes, we deduce that none of the observed large JFCs experiences significant spin changes. This suggests that large comet nuclei are less likely to undergo rotationally driven splitting, and therefore more likely to survive more perihelion passages than smaller nuclei. We find supporting evidence for this hypothesis in the cumulative size distributions of JFCs and dormant comets, as well as in recent numerical studies of cometary orbital dynamics. We added 143P to the sample of 13 other JFCs with known albedos and phase-function slopes. This sample shows a possible correlation of increasing phase-function slopes for larger geometric albedos. Partly based on findings from recent space missions to JFCs, we hypothesize that this correlation corresponds to an evolutionary trend for JFCs. We propose that newly activated JFCs have larger albedos and steeper phase functions, which gradually decrease due to sublimation-driven erosion. If confirmed, this could be used to analyse surface erosion from ground and to distinguish between dormant comets and asteroids.", "title": ["Implications of the small spin changes measured for large Jupiter-family comet nuclei"], "year": "2018"}
{"abstract": "In the course of a search for solar-like oscillations in bright late-type stars, Doppler variability was observed in the F5 subgiant Procyon. The variations have frequencies within a 1.1 mHz range centered at 0.9 mHz, and a total rms amplitude within that range of 2.5 m/s. Observations of Arcturus and scattered sunlight made with the same equipment during the same time interval show no such variation, indicating that the variations seen on Procyon are of stellar origin. The Doppler signal seen is entirely consistent with solar-like p-modes on Procyon, with maximum mode amplitudes of about 50 cm/s and periods around 20 minutes. Several statistical tests support the identification for the signal with narrow-band oscillations, but none does so conclusively. Assuming that the signal does arise from p-modes, there is evidence that the frequency splitting nu(0) is 71 micro-Hz. The data do not permit a definite estimate of this quantity, and other values of nu(0) fit the observations about equally well. In order to clarify the sources of ambiguity in this and similar observations, the data acquisition, reduction, and interpretation are described.", "title": ["Detection of Possible p-Mode Oscillations on Procyon"], "year": "1991"}
{"abstract": "When an extrasolar planet passes in front of (transits) its star, its radius can be measured from the decrease in starlight and its orbital period from the time between transits. Multiple planets transiting the same star reveal much more: period ratios determine stability and dynamics, mutual gravitational interactions reflect planet masses and orbital shapes, and the fraction of transiting planets observed as multiples has implications for the planarity of planetary systems. But few stars have more than one known transiting planet, and none has more than three. Here we report Kepler spacecraft observations of a single Sun-like star, which we call Kepler-11, that reveal six transiting planets, five with orbital periods between 10 and 47days and a sixth planet with a longer period. The five inner planets are among the smallest for which mass and size have both been measured, and these measurements imply substantial envelopes of light gases.

{"abstract": "Optimization toolbox for luminescence anisotropy measurements of fluid vorticity   Requirements   The toolbox requires the Non-Linear Least-Squares Minimization and Curve-Fitting for Python (lmfit) in a version of at least 1.0.0   Documentation can be found here.   Installation   Via Anaconda   In an existing anaconda install, it is advisable to install the requirements via conda prior to toolbox installation   To create a new environment named optivorti, and install Python 3.9 and the requirements, call   conda create -n optivorti python=3.9 anaconda conda activate optivorti conda install -c conda-forge lmfit   Finally, from the folder of pyoptivorticity, call the installation   python setup.py install   Via pip   If you use conda, install lmfit prior to installation of this toolbox. Then run in a terminal with Python environment you want to install pyoptivorticity   python setup.py install   This should install all requirements in your current environment via pip.   Theory   The toolbox uses a Cartesian coordinate system for the definition of the signals and vorticity.   The excitation is along the y-axis, while the observation is along the x-axis. Thus, the signal Izy is the signal with laser polarization oriented in z while the observed polarization is parallel to y.   The signals I__ are instantaneous signals, while D__ signals are time-integrated.   Usage   The main function for computation of the normalized vorticity signals is the function compute.vorticitynorm with the following parameters:    \t tau_l: luminescence lifetime \t tau_br: Brownian correlation time \t epsilon: the angle between excitation and emission transition moment \t Dxy: integrated signal in y, excited in x \t Dxz: integrated signal in z, excited in x \t Dzy: integrated signal in y, excited in z \t Dzz: integrated signal in z, excited in z \t estimate: an estimate of the vorticity. If none, the values are set to 1/tau_l \t nworkers: Number of workers. If none, no parallel computing is used.    The function returns a MinimizerResult object from lmfit. If the input objects for the signals are NumPy arrays, the result is a NumPy array as well, containing the MinimizerResults.   All timescales are normalized with the luminescence lifetime tau_l, e.g., tau_brn = tau_br / tau_l and omega_n = omega * tau_l.   Modules   The module analytical computes simplified one and two-component analytical solutions.   The module objectives provides a set of objective functions.

{"abstract": "Spicules are dynamic jets propelled upwards (at speeds of ~20kms<SUP>-1</SUP>) from the solar `surface' (photosphere) into the magnetized low atmosphere of the Sun. They carry a mass flux of 100 times that of the solar wind into the low solar corona. With diameters close to observational limits (&lt; 500km), spicules have been largely unexplained since their discovery in 1877: none of the existing models can account simultaneously for their ubiquity, evolution, energetics and recently discovered periodicity. Here we report a synthesis of modelling and high-spatial-resolution observations in which numerical simulations driven by observed photospheric velocities directly reproduce the observed occurrence and properties of individual spicules. Photospheric velocities are dominated by convective granulation (which has been considered before for spicule formation) and by p-modes (which are solar global resonant acoustic oscillations visible in the photosphere as quasi-sinusoidal velocity and intensity pulsations). We show that the previously ignored p-modes are crucial: on inclined magnetic flux tubes, the p-modes leak sufficient energy from the global resonant cavity into the chromosphere to power shocks that drive upward flows and form spicules.", "title": ["Solar chromospheric spicules from the leakage of photospheric oscillations and flows"], "year": "2004"}

The imaging data reveal a number of serendipitous hard X-ray sources in some source fields, but none contribute significantly to the hard X-ray flux of the active galactic nuclei. All but one of the Seyferts show evidence for variability on timescales of minutes to hours, with the amplitude anticorrelated with the source luminosity, confirming previous results. In at least eight sources there is evidence that the variability amplitude below 2 keV is greater than that in the hard X-ray band, perhaps indicating variable components other than the power law in the soft band. Ultrarapid variability, implying significant power at frequencies greater than 10<SUP>-3</SUP> Hz is detected in at least five sources but is difficult to detect in most cases, because of the sampling and signal-to-noise ratio.

After subtractions of PPXF method determined host galaxy contributions, the narrow emission lines of SDSS J0838 in the SDSS spectrum and in the eBOSS spectrum can be well measured by Gaussian functions, leading more than 90 per cent of [O III] emissions to be covered by the eBOSS fibre with diameter of 2 arcsec.

This includes other known RR Lyrae within the search area, as well as stars that fall within the expected range of magnitudes and colors for RR Lyrae (and yet outside the cutoff of two-thirds of the tidal radii of each globular cluster for something to be called extra-tidal) if they were extra-tidal RR Lyrae candidates for NGC 5024 or NGC 5053. Based on the the proper-motion information and their locations on the color-magnitude diagram, none of the known RR Lyrae belong to the extra-tidal RR Lyrae of either globular clusters. In the cases where the stars satisfied the magnitude and color ranges of RR Lyrae, analysis of time series data taken from the Zwicky Transient Facility do not reveal periodicities, suggesting that none of these stars are RR Lyrae.

Pour les composites polyethylene/bois, avec 3%Maleate de polyethylene (MAPE): (1) Tests de traction : le module elastique passe de 1.34 GPa a 4.19 GPa pour le composite HDPE/bouleau, alors qu'il passe de 1.34 GPa a 3.86 GPa pour le composite HDPE/tremble. La contrainte maximale passe de 22 MPa a 42.65 MPa pour le composite HDPE/bouleau, alors qu'elle passe de 22 MPa a 43.48 MPa pour le composite HDPE/tremble. (2) Tests de flexion : le module elastique passe de 1.04 GPa a 3.47 GPa pour le composite HDPE/bouleau et a 3.64 GPa pour le composite HDPE/tremble. La contrainte maximale passe de 23.90 MPa a 66.70 MPa pour le composite HDPE/bouleau, alors qu'elle passe a 59.51 MPa pour le composite HDPE/tremble. (3) Le coefficient de Poisson determine par impulsion acoustique est autour de 0.35 pour tous les composites HDPE/bois. (4) Le test de degradation thermique TGA nous revele que les materiaux composites presentent une stabilite thermique intermediaire entre les fibres de bois et la matrice HDPE. (5) Le test de mouillabilite (angle de contact) revele que l'ajout de fibres de bois ne diminue pas de facon significative les angles de contact avec de l'eau parce que les fibres de bois (bouleau ou tremble) semblent etre enveloppees par la matrice sur la surface des composites, comme le montrent des images prises au microscope electronique a balayage MEB. (6) Le modele de Lavengoof-Goettler predit mieux le module elastique du composite thermoplastique/bois. (7) Le HDPE renforce par 40 % de bouleau est mieux adapte pour la fabrication des engrenages, car le retrait est moins important lors du refroidissement au moulage. La simulation numerique semble mieux predire la temperature d'equilibre a la vitesse de 500 tr/min; alors qu'a 1000 tr/min, on remarque une divergence du modele. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.).

{"abstract": "One of the commonly used tools for detecting changes in climatic and hydrologic time series is trend analysis. A number of statistical tests exist to assess the significance of trends in time series. One of the commonly used non-parametric trend tests is the Mann-Kendall trend test. The null hypothesis in the Mann-Kendall test is that the data are independent and randomly ordered. However, the existence of positive autocorrelation in the data increases the probability of detecting trends when actually none exist, and vice versa. Although this is a well-known fact, few studies have addressed this issue, and autocorrelation in the data is often ignored. In this study, the effect of autocorrelation on the variance of the Mann-Kendall trend test statistic is discussed. A theoretical relationship is derived to calculate the variance of the Mann-Kendall test statistic for autocorrelated data. The special cases of AR(1) and MA(1) dependence are discussed as examples. An approximation to the theoretical relationship is also presented in order to reduce computation time for long time series. Based on the modified value of the variance of the Mann-Kendall trend test statistic, a modified non-parametric trend test which is suitable for autocorrelated data is proposed. The accuracy of the modified test in terms of its empirical significance level was found to be superior to that of the original Mann-Kendall trend test without any loss of power. The modified test is applied to rainfall as well as streamflow data to demonstrate its performance as compared to the original Mann-Kendall trend test.", "title": ["A modified Mann-Kendall trend test for autocorrelated data"], "year": "1998"}

{"abstract": "The Achala batholith of Argentina contains very unusual layered enclaves containing up to 30% apatite and 50% biotite in some layers.

Nor can the enclaves represent metasedimentary xenoliths because: (1) none of the Precambrian wall rocks has these compositions; (2) none of the metasedimentary xenoliths present within the batholith shows any degree of transition to the mica-apatite-rich enclaves; (3) the compositions and textures in the enclaves are inconsistent with metasediments; (4) a geochronological study of zircon from an enclave gives an age of 368 \u00b1 2 Ma, the exact age of zircons in the granitic host rocks. For these reasons, we conclude that the enclaves are neither xenoliths of Precambrian wall rocks nor restite of a Precambrian source. The identical age of the enclave and the host granites, coupled with textural, mineralogical, and bulk-rock characteristics of the enclaves, indicates that the enclaves are magmatic segregations, i.e., cumulates. The F-rich nature of the stubby-shaped apatites and biotites indicates a high F content of the magma parental to the enclaves. We infer that the viscosity of the melt was lowered sufficiently to allow cumulates to form in spite of the granitic composition of the melt.", "title": ["Origin of biotite-apatite-rich enclaves, Achala batholith, Argentina"], "year": "1997"}
{"abstract": "The ionosphere's total electron content (TEC) is a parameter widely used in studies of the near-Earth plasma environment. The scientific use of TEC appeared early in the artificial satellite era, and among its many contributions were fundamental insights into how the ionosphere responds to geomagnetic storms. While many excellent reviews of solar-terrestrial disturbances exist in the literature, none have concentrated on the TEC parameter per se. With new TEC data sets increasingly available from the Global Positioning System (GPS), a comprehensive summary of pre-GPS storm studies is needed to set the base for progress in the GPS era. This review summarizes past case studies, describes statistical occurrence pattern, and identifies responsible mechanisms validated via modeling. It presents a new set of results of TEC disturbance patterns during 180 geomagnetic storms to describe seasonal and solar cycle effects.

None of the elliptical galaxies and only about 25 percent of the lenticular galaxies scanned were detected. The range of infrared-to-blue luminosity ratios, a measure of the infrared excess of galaxies, is large, varying from roughly 0.1 to roughly 5. The data suggest that weakly infrared emitting galaxies are cool (100-60 micron color temperatures of about 25 K), while the more infrared luminous ones tend to be warmer (about 50 K).

However, diamond covered with chemically bound hydrogen shows a pronounced conductivity when exposed to air. This conductivity arises from positive-charge carriers (holes) and is confined to a narrow near-surface region. Although several explanations have been proposed, none has received wide acceptance, and the mechanism remains controversial. Here, we report the interactions of hydrogen-terminated, macroscopic diamonds and diamond powders with aqueous solutions of controlled pH and oxygen concentration. We show that electrons transfer between the diamond and an electrochemical reduction/oxidation couple involving oxygen. This charge transfer is responsible for the surface conductivity and also influences contact angles and zeta potentials. The effect is not confined to diamond and may play a previously unrecognized role in other disparate systems.", "title": ["Charge Transfer Equilibria Between Diamond and an Aqueous Oxygen Electrochemical Redox Couple"], "year": "2007"}

{"abstract": "While we know that understory vegetation affects the soil microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activities in subtropical Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) forests, we are less certain about the degree of its influence. We determined the degree to which the soil abiotic and biotic properties, such as PLFAs and extracellular enzyme activities, were controlled by understory vegetation. We established a paired treatment in a subtropical Chinese fir plantation, which comprised one plot from which the understory vegetation and litter were removed (None) and another from which the litter was removed but the understory vegetation was left intact (Understory). We evaluated how the understory vegetation influenced the soil abiotic properties, the bacterial, fungal, and actinobacterial PLFAs, and the activities of five hydrolases and two oxidative enzymes. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon, soil organic carbon, ammonia nitrogen (NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>-N), and total nitrogen contents and soil moisture were 18 %, 25 %, 12 %, 34 %, 8 %, and 4 % lower in the None treatments than in the Understory treatments, respectively (P&lt;0.05). Soil bacterial, fungal, and total PLFAs, and the potential activities of \u03b2-1,4-glucosidase (\u03b2G), \u03b2-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase, were as much as 24 % lower in None treatments than in Understory treatments (P&lt;0.05). The specific activities of C-acquiring enzymes were as much as 41 % higher (P&lt;0.05), and the ratio of C- to N-acquiring enzymes was also higher in the None treatments than in the Understory treatments. This suggests that in the absence of understory vegetation microbes invested more in C acquisition than N acquisition because the carbon (C) inputs were less labile. The negative relationship between DOC and AP shows that DOC is consumed when P-acquiring enzymes are produced. The positive correlation between NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>-N and \u03b2G suggested the increased availability of N promoted the decomposition of C. More extracellular enzymes that degrade soil organic matter are produced when there is understory vegetation, which leads to losses of soil C. On the other hand, the soil C sink is maintained by increased inputs of C. We can therefore conclude that understory vegetation contributes to C sequestration in Chinese fir forests and suggest that understory should be maintained to sustain soil quality in subtropical Chinese fir plantations.", "title": ["Understory vegetation plays the key role in sustaining soil microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activities"], "year": "2018"}

Calcium transients produced by all-or-none responses were not restricted to the sites of photolysis, but occurred throughout individual distal dendritic compartments, indicating that electrogenesis is mediated primarily by voltage-gated calcium channels.

We find that none of the observational markers improve the chances of correctly identifying a given star as triggered by more than factors of 2 at most.

Specifically, we first elucidate a) key factors underpinning patch attack success and b) the impact of distributional shift between training and testing/deployment when cast under the Expectation over Transformation (EoT) formalism. By focusing our analysis on three principal classes of transformations (rotation, scale, and location), our findings provide quantifiable insights into the design of effective patch attacks and demonstrate that scale, among all factors, significantly impacts patch attack success. Working from these findings, we then focus on addressing how to overcome the principal limitations of scale for the deployment of attacks in real physical settings: namely the obtrusiveness of large patches. Our strategy is to turn to the novel design of irregularly-shaped, semi-transparent partial patches which we construct via a new optimization process that jointly addresses the antagonistic goals of mitigating obtrusiveness and maximizing effectiveness.

Data were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Results showed that threat sensitivity, insurance status, and age were associated with the most frequent source of healthcare utilization. Compared to men who most commonly used a doctor's office or clinic, men who tended to use an emergency room had higher levels of threat sensitivity and those with no usual healthcare source had lower levels of threat sensitivity.

The \"all-or-none event\" which triggers mitosis is postulated to involve the doubling of the number of the structural effectors which are then temporarily in an active state, thus initiating mitosis. The subsequent segregation during mitosis of the active structural effectors to the two dividing nuclei allows the initiation of S phase as soon as the chromosomal replicative machinery is ready.", "title": ["Involvement of an \"all-or-none event\" in the triggering of chromosome segregation and of S phase in procaryotic and eucaryotic cells"], "year": "1980"}

WINTER \u03b3(N<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>) values exhibited the strongest correlation with aerosol water content, but weak correlations with other variables, such as aerosol nitrate and organics, suggesting a complex, nonlinear dependence on multiple factors, or an additional dependence on a nonobserved factor. This factor may be related to aerosol phase, morphology (i.e., core shell), or mixing state, none of which are commonly measured during aircraft field studies. Despite general agreement with previous laboratory observations, comparison of WINTER data with 14 literature parameterizations (used to predict \u03b3(N<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>) in chemical transport models) confirms that none of the current methods reproduce the full range of \u03b3(N<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>) values.

{"abstract": "Gravitational lensing by massive objects along the line of sight to the source causes distortions to gravitational wave (GW) signals; such distortions may reveal information about fundamental physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. In this work, we have extended the search for lensing signatures to all binary black hole events from the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo network. We search for repeated signals from strong lensing by (1) performing targeted searches for subthreshold signals, (2) calculating the degree of overlap among the intrinsic parameters and sky location of pairs of signals, (3) comparing the similarities of the spectrograms among pairs of signals, and (4) performing dual-signal Bayesian analysis that takes into account selection effects and astrophysical knowledge. We also search for distortions to the gravitational waveform caused by (1) frequency-independent phase shifts in strongly lensed images, and (2) frequency-dependent modulation of the amplitude and phase due to point masses. None of these searches yields significant evidence for lensing. Finally, we use the nondetection of GW lensing to constrain the lensing rate based on the latest merger-rate estimates and the fraction of dark matter composed of compact objects.", "title": ["Search for Gravitational-lensing Signatures in the Full Third Observing Run of the LIGO\u2013Virgo Network"], "year": "2024"}

We also discuss the excitation properties of these sources, and compare them with local strong-line metallicity calibrations. We find that none of the considered diagnostics match simultaneously the observed relations between metallicity and strong-line ratios for the three sources, implying that a proper re-assessment of the calibrations may be needed at these redshifts. On the mass-metallicity plane, the two galaxies at z ~ 7.6 ($\\rm log(M_*/M_{\\odot }) = 8.1, 8.7$) have metallicities that are consistent with the extrapolation of the mass-metallicity relation at z~2-3, while the least massive galaxy at z ~ 8.5 ($\\rm log(M_*/M_{\\odot }) = 7.8$) shows instead a significantly lower metallicity. The three galaxies show different level of offset relative to the Fundamental Metallicity Relation, with two of them (at z~ 7.6) being marginally consistent, while the z~ 8.5 source deviating significantly, being probably far from the smooth equilibrium between gas flows, star formation, and metal enrichment in place at later epochs.", "title": ["The chemical enrichment in the early Universe as probed by JWST via direct metallicity measurements at z \u223c 8"], "year": "2023"}

While nearly 1,900 exoplanets have now been discovered and confirmed, none are still in the process of formation. Transition disks, protoplanetary disks with inner clearings best explained by the influence of accreting planets, are natural laboratories for the study of planet formation. Some transition disks show evidence for the presence of young planets in the form of disk asymmetries or infrared sources detected within their clearings, as in the case of LkCa 15 (refs 8, 9). Attempts to observe directly signatures of accretion onto protoplanets have hitherto proven unsuccessful. Here we report adaptive optics observations of LkCa 15 that probe within the disk clearing.

{"abstract": "Item recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized ranking on a set of items (e.g. websites, movies, products). In this paper, we investigate the most common scenario with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks, purchases). There are many methods for item recommendation from implicit feedback like matrix factorization (MF) or adaptive knearest-neighbor (kNN). Even though these methods are designed for the item prediction task of personalized ranking, none of them is directly optimized for ranking. In this paper we present a generic optimization criterion BPR-Opt for personalized ranking that is the maximum posterior estimator derived from a Bayesian analysis of the problem. We also provide a generic learning algorithm for optimizing models with respect to BPR-Opt. The learning method is based on stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling. We show how to apply our method to two state-of-the-art recommender models: matrix factorization and adaptive kNN. Our experiments indicate that for the task of personalized ranking our optimization method outperforms the standard learning techniques for MF and kNN. The results show the importance of optimizing models for the right criterion.", "title": ["BPR: Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback"], "year": "2012"}
{"abstract": "Single-molecule manipulation techniques reveal that stretching unravels individually folded domains in the muscle protein titin and the extracellular matrix protein tenascin. These elastic proteins contain tandem repeats of folded domains with -sandwich architecture. Herein, we propose by stretching two model sequences (S1 and S2) with four-stranded -barrel topology that unfolding forces and pathways in folded domains can be predicted by using only the structure of the native state. Thermal refolding of S1 and S2 in the absence of force proceeds in an all-or-none fashion. In contrast, phase diagrams in the force-temperature (f,T) plane and steered Langevin dynamics studies of these sequences, which differ in the native registry of the strands, show that S1 unfolds in an allor-none fashion, whereas unfolding of S2 occurs via an obligatory intermediate. Force-induced unfolding is determined by the native topology. After proving that the simulation results for S1 and S2 can be calculated by using native topology alone, we predict the order of unfolding events in Ig domain (Ig27) and two fibronectin III type domains (<SUP>9</SUP>FnIII and <SUP>10</SUP>FnIII). The calculated unfolding pathways for these proteins, the location of the transition states, and the pulling speed dependence of the unfolding forces reflect the differences in the way the strands are arranged in the native states. We also predict the mechanisms of force-induced unfolding of the coiled-coil spectrin (a three-helix bundle protein) for all 20 structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank.

Merr.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown under management systems that include annual or biannual non-inversion deep tillage. In a field study in the southeastern Coastal Plains of the USA, we tested this relationship for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) grown in wide (0.96 m) rows, hypothesizing that root growth and lint yield of cotton would increase with a decrease in soil strength associated with annual deep tillage or cover crop. Root growth and yield were evaluated for treatment combinations of surface tillage or none, deep tillage or none, and rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop or none. Root growth increased (r <SUP>2</SUP>=0.66-0.68) as mean or maximum soil strength decreased. Cotton lint yield was not significantly affected by the treatments. Lack of yield response to tillage treatment may have been the result of management practices that employed a small (3 m wide) disk in surface-tilled plots and maintained traffic lanes, both of which help prevent re-compaction. These results indicate that less than annual frequency of subsoiling might be a viable production practice for cotton grown in traditionally wide (0.96 m) rows on a Coastal Plain soil (fine loamy Acrisol-Typic Kandiudult).

It is found that only about half of the long-term (several month) average ice motion is directly related to the geostrophic wind, the other half being due to the mean ocean circulation. On shorter time scales and in all seasons, more than 70% of the variance of the ice velocity in the central Arctic Ocean is explained by the geostrophic wind. Within about 400 km of the coasts the geostrophic wind is less successful in explaining the ice motion. The spatial variations in ice velocity are also partly explained by the geostrophic wind. About half of the variance in the large-scale ice vorticity and shear are accounted for. On the other hand, none of the large-scale ice divergence can be explained by the wind.

Samples were collected with polyethylene screens in the estuarine waters of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, the coastal waters of the New York Bight, and open ocean regions between Iceland and Nova Scotia. Metal enrichment in the `particulate' and `chloroform-extractable' fraction of the surface microlayer compared to water 20 cm below the surface varied from virtually none up to approximately 50 for copper, iron, and nickel and up to 20 for lead in the Narragansett Bay samples. There was no enrichment in the soluble, `inorganic' fraction of the surface microlayer for those metals in Narragansett Bay.

None of the New York Bight or open ocean samples were collected while observable slicks were present. Significant enrichments in particulate and chloroform-extractable phases in the surface microlayer still occurred in the majority of cases in both areas. The variability of its occurrence and magnitude may be due to several factors, including the presence of coherent slicks, biological activity, and local pollution sources, both atmospheric and water.

Dark-matter-free TDGs may constitute a significant component of the dwarf galaxy population. However it remains to be demonstrated that TDGs can survive their formation phase given stellar feedback processes, the time variable tidal field of the post-encounter host galaxy, and its dark matter halo and ram pressure wind from the gaseous halo of the host. For robust results the maximally damaging feedback by a fully populated invariant stellar initial mass function in each star cluster is assumed, such that fractions of massive stars contribute during phases of low star formation rates (SFRs). The model galaxies are studied in terms of their star formation history, chemical enrichment, and rotational curves. All models evolve into a self-regulated long-term equilibrium star formation phase lasting for the full simulation time, whereby the TDGs become significantly more compact and sustain significantly higher SFRs through compressive tides than the isolated model.

Fuel consumption reduction is of special importance for two reasons: first, because the aeronautical industry is responsible of 2% of the CO2 released to the atmosphere, and second, because it will reduce the flight cost. The aircraft fuel model was obtained from a numerical performance database which was created and validated by our industrial partner from flight experimental test data. A new methodology using the numerical database was proposed in this thesis to compute the fuel burn for a given trajectory. Weather parameters such as wind and temperature were taken into account as they have an important effect in fuel burn.

Most of the arguments against the idea of a flatness problem are based on the change with time of the density parameter \u03a9 and normalized cosmological constant \u03bb (often assumed to be zero before there was strong evidence that it has a non-negligible positive value) and, since the Hubble constant H is not considered, are independent of time scale. In addition, taking the time scale into account, it is sometimes claimed that fine-tuning is required in order to produce a Universe which neither collapsed after a short time nor expanded so quickly that no structure formation could take place. None of those claims is correct, whether or not the cosmological constant is assumed to be zero. I briefly review the literature disputing the existence of the flatness problem, which is not as well known as it should be, compare it with some similar persistent misunderstandings, and wonder about the source of confusion.", "title": ["Arguments against the flatness problem in classical cosmology: a review"], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "This paper analytically and computationally examines the transient jet used to ignite combustible mixtures during Turbulent Jet Ignition (TJI). In TJI the ignition source, which originates in the prechamber, enters through a connecting nozzle into the main chamber as a transient high temperature jet of reacted mixture, reacting mixture and active radicals. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is developed for the flow field, density gradients, turbulence intensity, and temperature fields in both the prechamber and the main chamber. None of these quantities are currently measurable. The pressure traces computed using four (4) comprehensive chemical kinetic mechanisms (San Diego, Aramco, GRI, and, NUI) and one (1) reduced chemical kinetic mechanism are compared with the experimental pressure data. Results indicate that none of the mechanisms are in complete agreement, however they are in good agreement with the experimental burn rate, peak pressure and ignition delay predictions. Comparison is made of the simulations with high speed chemiluminescence images of combustion and measured pressure traces in a Rapid Compression Machine (RCM). The influences of nozzle size and mixture stoichiometry on jet penetration speed and combustion performance are investigated. Normalized transient results are presented that produce good agreement between the various classes of model predictions. A discussion is provided of a new correlation model for the transient TJI process.", "title": ["A study of the turbulent jet flow field in a methane fueled turbulent jet ignition (TJI) system"], "year": "2017"}
{"abstract": "We explored the statistical properties of short-term X-ray variability using long-exposure XMM-Newton data during high X-ray variability phases of blazars S5 0716+714 and PKS 2155-304. In general, the hardness ratio shows correlated variations with the source flux state (count rate), but in a few cases, mainly the bright phases, the trend is complex with both correlation and anti-correlation, indicating spectral evolution. Stationarity tests suggest the time series are non-stationarity or have trend stationarity. Except for one, none of the histogram fits resulted in a reduced-\u03c72\u223c1 for a normal and log-normal profile but a normal profile is favored in general. On the contrary, the Anderson\u2013Darling test favors log-normal with a test-statistic value lower for log-normal over normal for all the observations, even if out of significance limits. None of the IDs show linear RMS-flux relation. The contrary inferences from different widely used statistical methods indicate that a careful analysis is needed while the complex behavior of count rate with hardness ratio suggests spectral evolution over a few 10 s of kilo-seconds during bright phases of the sources. In these cases, the spectrum extracted from whole observation may not be meaningful for spectral studies and certainly not a true representation of the spectral state of the source.", "title": ["Short-Term X-ray Variability during Different Activity Phases of Blazars S5 0716+714 and PKS 2155-304"], "year": "2020"}
{"abstract": "The results of two preceding articles on the energy dependence of the reaction and scattering cross sections are generalized. As before, the configuration space is divided into two parts. In the internal region or reaction zone there is no restriction on the type of interaction between the particles. In the external region, on the other hand, the interaction takes place between the colliding or separating particles without changing their structure (wave function). The present article deals with a more general situation than the preceding ones, first by allowing for an interaction, although only of a restricted type, outside the reaction zone. The most common type of interaction which plays a role outside the reaction zone is the electrostatic interaction of the colliding or separating particles. In addition, the present article does not restrict the angular momentum of the particles to zero, but permits the treatment of arbitrary angular momenta. The cross sections are expressed in well-known fashion in terms of the collision matrix U which is, of course, independent of the size of the internal region. U, in its turn, is expressed by the R matrix ((35) and (38)) and the quantities \u03c9, B, and C describing the interaction in the external region. R as function of energy is given by (24), and a number of properties of this function are enumerated. None of the quantities R, \u03c9, B, and C are strictly independent of the size of the internal region, although the combination (38), i.e., the collision matrix, of course, is.", "title": ["Higher Angular Momenta and Long Range Interaction in Resonance Reactions"], "year": "1947"}

{"abstract": "We study \u201cfrustrated\u201d hopping models, in which at least one energy band\u2014at the maximum or minimum of the spectrum\u2014is dispersionless. The states of the flat band(s) can be represented in a basis, which is fully localized, having support on a vanishing fraction of the system in the thermodynamic limit. In the majority of examples, a dispersive band touches the flat band(s) at a number of discrete points in momentum space. We demonstrate that this band touching is related to states which exhibit nontrivial topology in real-space. Specifically, these states have support on one-dimensional loops which wind around the entire system (with periodic boundary conditions). A counting argument is given that determines, in each case, whether there is band touching or none, in precise correspondence to the result of straightforward diagonalization. When they are present, the topological structure protects the band touchings in the sense that they can only be removed by perturbations, which also split the degeneracy of the flat band.", "title": ["Band touching from real-space topology in frustrated hopping models"], "year": "2008"}
{"abstract": "Rational decision making (for flood warning, navigation, or reservoir systems) requires that the total uncertainty about a hydrologic predictand (such as river stage, discharge, or runoff volume) be quantified in terms of a probability distribution, conditional on all available information and knowledge.

Fundamentals are presented of a Bayesian forecasting system (BFS) for producing a probabilistic forecast of a hydrologic predictand via any deterministic catchment model. The BFS decomposes the total uncertainty into input uncertainty and hydrologic uncertainty, which are quantified independently and then integrated into a predictive (Bayes) distribution. This distribution results from a revision of a prior (climatic) distribution, is well calibrated, and has a nonnegative ex ante economic value.

The new material contains microstructure designed according to concepts taken from the field of photonic band gap materials. In the RF range, it has a magnetic permeability that can be produced to specification while exhibiting negligible direct-current magnetism. The latter property is vital to avoid perturbing the static and audio-frequency magnetic fields needed to obtain image and spectral data.

Despite potential confirmation in legacy Pioneer Venus mass spectrometry data, the detection remains controversial.

None of these potential phosphine production pathways is sufficient to explain the presence of phosphine in Venus atmosphere at near the observed abundance. The source of atmospheric PH3 could be unknown geo- or photochemistry, which would imply that the consensus on Venus' chemistry is significantly incomplete.

Here we synthesize the available geochemical proxy records of sea surface temperature and show that, compared with that of today, the early Pliocene climate had substantially lower meridional and zonal temperature gradients but similar maximum ocean temperatures. Using an Earth system model, we show that none of the mechanisms currently proposed to explain Pliocene warmth can simultaneously reproduce all three crucial features.

{"abstract": "We investigate three of the most frequently used methods to reduce fusion and total reaction excitation functions. For this purpose, we apply them in two situations. First, we consider theoretical cross sections obtained by single-channel calculations based on standard optical potentials. In this case, the cross sections are not influenced by any particular nuclear property. Thus, the method is successful if the cross sections for different systems are about the same. In the case of fusion excitation functions, we found that the fusion function method works very well, being much better than the other two methods. Regarding total reaction excitation functions, none of the methods is satisfactory. Their reduced reaction cross sections maintain a strong dependence on the atomic and mass numbers of the collision partners. However, they perform reasonably well when compared to similar systems. Next, we use the three methods to reduce experimental fusion and reaction cross sections for many systems, over a broad mass range. Our conclusions are consistent with the ones reached for our theoretical cross sections, resulting from single-channel calculations. That is, the fusion function method is the best for fusion data, whereas none of the three methods works for total reaction.", "title": ["Reduction of fusion and reaction cross sections at near-barrier energies"], "year": "2015"}
{"abstract": "SEM and EPMA analysis are powerful tools for documenting and evaluating the relationships between minerals in thin sections and for determining chemical compositions in-situ. The time and costs associated with determining major, minor, and some trace element concentrations in geologic materials can be reduced due to advances in EDS spectrometer performance and the availability of software tools such as NIST DTSA II to perform multiple linear least squares (MLLS) fitting of energy spectra from standards to the spectra from samples recorded under the same analytical conditions. MLLS fitting is able to overcome spectral peak overlaps among the transition-metal elements that commonly occur in oxide minerals, which had previously been seen as too difficult for EDS analysis, allowing for rapid and accurate determination of concentrations. The quantitative use of EDS is demonstrated in the chemical analysis of magnetite (NMNH 114887) and ilmenite (NMNH 96189) from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum Microbeam Standards Collection. Average concentrations from nine total spots over three grains are given in mass % listed as (recommended; measured concentration \u00b1 one standard deviation). Spectra were collected for sixty seconds live time at 15 kV and 10 nA over a 12 micrometer wide scan area.

{"abstract": "Air pollution is a major environmental health problem focusing on the ambient air quality in cities but also on the air quality of indoor environments, where people spend most of their time. In order to evaluate the real impacts of urban air pollution in the population health is necessary to undergo a complete assessment of human exposure to atmospheric pollutants that includes both outdoor and indoor exposure assessments. The main goals of this study are the development of a three-dimensional (3D) Microscale EXPOsure model (MEXPO) to estimate the short-term individual exposure to PM10 and NO2 and its application to the Viseu urban area, using experimental data from two field campaigns, in order to assess the exposure to the referred pollutants on children with known respiratory problems. To perfom this goal the exposure model is able to estimate the outdoor flow and pollutant concentrations, considering the influence of the urban built-up area, as well to assess the air exchange rates as result of natural ventilation mechanisms. The indoor pollutant concentrations on the defined microenvironments are also estimated by the model. With the purpose of estimating the outdoor pollutant dispersion, the exposure model MEXPO includes a Computational Fluid Dynamic model (CFD) model that has the advantage to fully characterize the flow and the transport of the urban air pollution on a 3D basis. The CFD model was successfully evaluated according to a established procedure, using specific model acceptance criteria that were defined in agreement with the intended model purpose, which is the study of meteorology and pollutant dispersion in urban areas. The application of MEXPO to the Viseu urban area allowed determining the most exposed children to PM10 and NO2 concentrations during both campaigns. These children are therefore more sensitive to develop respiratory problems such as asthma. The developed methodology may be seen as a valid approach to assess the individual human exposure to atmospheric pollutants in urban areas, replacing direct measurement techniques that are considered invasive and expensive. The developed exposure model has also an important role in the application to future climate change scenarios with direct consequences in the urban climate, allowing to determine the future human exposure to atmospheric pollutants and, consequently, also the future outdoor and indoor atmospheric pollutants concentrations in an urban area.

Then by constructing a proof-of-concept metamaterial sample with twisted split ring resonator patterns on both sides of a dielectric slab, we demonstrate substantial asymmetric transmission for linear polarizations, but none for circular polarizations through full-wave simulation and measurement at microwave frequency. Strong optical activity is found in the chiral metamaterial indicating that the intriguing asymmetric transmission is caused by the directional difference in cross polarization conversion. By scaling down the structure, the proposed concept could be utilized in other frequency bands, such as terahertz and optical range.", "title": ["Asymmetric electromagnetic wave transmission of linear polarization via polarization conversion through chiral metamaterial structures"], "year": "2012"}
{"abstract": "According to the inflationary scenario for the very early Universe, all inhomogeneities in the Universe are of genuine quantum origin. On the other hand, looking at these inhomogeneities and measuring them, clearly no specific quantum mechanical properties are observed. We show how the transition from their inherent quantum gravitational nature to classical behavior comes about \u2014 a transition whereby none of the successful quantitative predictions of the inflationary scenario for the present-day universe is changed. This is made possible by two properties. First, the quantum state for the spacetime metric perturbations produced by quantum gravitational effects in the early Universe becomes very special (highly squeezed) as a result of the expansion of the Universe (as long as the wavelength of the perturbations exceeds the Hubble radius). Second, decoherence through the environment distinguishes the field amplitude basis as being the pointer basis. This renders the perturbations presently indistinguishable from stochastic classical inhomogeneities.", "title": ["Quantum-To Transition for Fluctuations in the Early Universe"], "year": "1998"}
{"abstract": "Recently Assef et al. presented two catalogs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates over 30,093 deg<SUP>2</SUP> selected from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) observations. From their most reliable sample, Assef et al. identified 45 AGN candidates with the highest variability levels in the AllWISE catalog but that are not blazars. Here we present new spectroscopic observations of some of these targets to further constrain their nature. We also study their optical light curves using observations from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) and find that only seven show significant optical variability, and that five of those seven are spectroscopically classified as AGNs. In one of them, WISEA J094806.56+031801.7 (W0948+0318), we identify a transient event in the CRTS light curve. We present a detailed analysis of this transient and characterize it through its CRTS light curve and its multiwavelength spectral energy distribution obtained from GALEX, Pan-STARRS, and WISE observations. We find that the most likely source of the transient is a superluminous supernova (SLSN) in W0948+0318. We estimate the total radiated energy to be E = (1.6 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg, making it one of the most energetic SLSNe observed. Based on the lack of change in mid-IR color throughout and after the transient event, we speculate that the location of the SLSN is within the torus of the AGN. We identify nine possible analogs to W0948+0318 based on their WISE light curves. None show optically detected transients and hence suggest significant dust obscuration. Finally, we estimate a rate of &gt;2 \u00d7 10<SUP>-7</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> per AGN for these transients under the conservative assumption that none of the identified analogs have a common origin with the transient in W0948+0318.", "title": ["A Luminous Transient Event in a Sample of WISE-selected Variable AGNs"], "year": "2018"}
{"abstract": "G ST and its relatives are often interpreted as measures of differentiation between subpopulations, with values near zero supposedly indicating low differentiation. However, GST necessarily approaches zero when gene diversity is high, even if subpopulations are completely differentiated, and it is not monotonic with increasing differentiation. Likewise, when diversity is equated with heterozygosity, standard similarity measures formed by taking the ratio of mean within-subpopulation diversity to total diversity necessarily approach unity when diversity is high, even if the subpopulations are completely dissimilar (no shared alleles). None of these measures can be interpreted as measures of differentiation or similarity. The derivations of these measures contain two subtle misconceptions which cause their paradoxical behaviours. Conclusions about population differentiation, gene flow, relatedness, and conservation priority will often be wrong when based on these fixation indices or similarity measures. These are not statistical issues; the problems persist even when true population frequencies are used in the calculations. Recent advances in the mathematics of diversity identify the misconceptions, and yield mathematically consistent descriptive measures of population structure which eliminate the paradoxes produced by standard measures. These measures can be directly related to the migration and mutation rates of the finite-island model.", "title": ["GST and its relatives do not measure differentiation"], "year": "2008"}

We propose that this new population of galaxies represents an extension of the high-redshift submillimeter galaxy population but with hotter characteristic dust temperatures that shift the peak of their far-IR emission to shorter wavelengths, reducing the submillimeter flux below the sensitivity of current instruments. Therefore, surveys in the submillimeter waveband may miss up to half of the most luminous, dusty galaxies at z~2.

A general method is presented for constructing Kaluza-Klein instantons based on solutions of ordinary Yang-Mills theory. It is argued that none of these will lead to a breakdown of quantum mechanics.

{"abstract": "We examine the sky distribution of radio galaxies in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS). Analyses of these samples have reported tension between their inferred dipoles and the kinematic dipole of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This represents a challenge to the traditional assumption that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales: the cosmological principle. We find that NVSS and RACS contain local radio sources that give a non-negligible contribution to the overall dipole signal. These need to be adequately accounted for since the aim is to probe the composition of the Universe at large scales. By appropriately considering these sources, the inferred dipole amplitude in either sample is reduced. None the less, we find support for a dipole aligning with that of the CMB but larger in amplitude, especially in the joint analysis. However, the 'clustering dipole' - the contribution of local sources to the net inferred dipole - appears to align with the direction of the CMB dipole, and its magnitude increases as deeper nearby sources are considered up to a comoving distance of \u2248130 Mpc (h = 0.7).

{"abstract": "We carried out observations of bright optical carbon stars by the ISO SWS, and detected the absorption features of CO, CS, CH, SiS and HCN in N-type and SC-type stars. We found several characteristics of molecular absorption features corresponding to the spectral types. The CH fundamental bands in 3-4 mu m in N-type stars are stronger than those in SC-type stars. On the other hand, the first overtone bands of SiS at 6.6 mu m were detected in WZ Cas (SC-type), while none of them were detected in N-type stars. These results can be explained well by the lower C/O ratio in SC-type stars than in N-type stars. The absorption features of HCN (nu_ {1}, nu_ {2}+nu_ {3} and nu_ {1}-nu_ {2}) are stronger in SC-type stars than in N-type stars. This fact can be explained by the cooler atmospheres of our SC-type stars due to the lower C/O ratio as well as to the lower effective temperature, compared with the N-type stars in our sample. The CS first overtone bands and the band heads of the CO fundamental bands are weaker in the observed spectra than in the ones predicted by our model atmospheres. Though the fundamental bands of CS were detected in TX Psc (N-type), the band heads are quite weak, and none of the fundamental bands of CS were identified in the other stars. These results suggest a contribution by the emission of CO and CS in the outer atmosphere.

{"abstract": "We analyze the IUE UV and the optical spectra of 39 starburst and blue compact galaxies in order to study the average properties of dust extinction in extended regions of galaxies. The optical spectra have been obtained using an aperture which matches that of IUE, so comparable regions within each galaxy are sampled. The data from the 39 galaxies are compared with five models for the geometrical distribution of dust, adopting as extinction laws both the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud laws. The commonly used uniform dust screen is included among the models. We find that none of the five models is in satisfactory agreement with the data. In order to understand the discrepancy between the data and the models, we have derived an extinction law directly from the data in the UV and optical wavelength range. The resulting curve is characterized by an overall slope which is more gray than the Milky Way extinction law's slope, and by the absence of the 2175 A dust feature. Remarkably, the difference in optical depth between the Balmer emission lines H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 is about a factor of 2 larger than the difference in the optical depth between the continuum underlying the two Balmer lines. We interpret this discrepancy as a consequence of the fact that the hot ionizing stars are associated with dustier regions than the cold stellar population is. The absence of the 2175 A dust feature can be due either to the effects of the scattering and clumpiness of the dust or to a chemical composition different from that of the Milky Way dust grains. Disentangling the two interpretations is not easy because of the complexity of the spatial distribution of the emitting region. The extinction law of UV and optical spectral continua of extended regions can be applied to the spectra of medium- and high-redshift galaxies, where extended regions of a galaxy are, by necessity, sampled.", "title": ["Dust Extinction of the Stellar Continua in Starburst Galaxies: The Ultraviolet and Optical Extinction Law"], "year": "1994"}

This would allow for the implementation of optical devices with new functionalities such as single-photon switches/transistors or controlled-phase gates. Although nonlinear optics effects at the single-emitter level have been demonstrated in a number of systems, none of these experiments showed single-photon switching on ultrafast timescales. Here, we perform pulsed two-colour spectroscopy and demonstrate that, in a strongly coupled quantum dot-cavity system, the presence of a single photon on one of the fundamental polariton transitions can turn on light scattering on a transition from the first to the second Jaynes-Cummings manifold. The overall switching time of this single-photon all-optical switch is ~50 ps. In addition, we use the single-photon nonlinearity to implement a pulse correlator. Our quantum dot-cavity system could form the building block of future high-bandwidth photonic networks operating in the quantum regime.", "title": ["Ultrafast all-optical switching by single photons"], "year": "2012"}

{"abstract": "A comprehensive study of the measurement of star formation histories from colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) is presented, with an emphasis on a variety of subtle issues involved in the generation of model CMDs and maximum likelihood solution. Among these are the need for a complete sampling of the synthetic CMD, the use of proper statistics for dealing with Poisson-distributed data (and a demonstration of why \u03c7 <SUP>2</SUP> must not be used), measuring full uncertainties in all reported parameters, quantifying the goodness-of-fit, and questions of binning the CMD and incorporating outside information. Several example star formation history measurements are given. Two examples involve synthetic data, in which the input and recovered parameters can be compared to locate possible flaws in the methodology (none were apparent) and measure the accuracy with which ages, metallicities and star formation rates can be recovered. Solutions of the histories of seven Galactic dwarf spheroidal companions (Carina, Draco, Leo I, Leo II, Sagittarius, Sculptor and Ursa Minor) illustrate the ability to measure star formation histories given a variety of conditions - numbers of stars, complexity of star formation history and amount of foreground contamination.

{"abstract": "Chlorocruorin is a dichroic red-green respiratory protein. It is chemically similar to haemoglobin, and is only found dissolved in the blood of certain marine annelid worms. Chlorocruorin is the characteristic blood pigment of the Serpulimorpha (serpulids and sabellids), but in the genus Serpula both chlorocruorin and haemoglobin are present together in the blood. This is the first time that two respiratory pigments have been found in the blood of one animal. Young individuals have relatively more haemoglobin, older ones more chlorocruorin. Within the serpulid genus Spirorbis, one species has chlorocruorin in its blood, another has haemoglobin, while a third has neither pigment. As their habitats are similar, no functional explanation for these differences suggests itself. The oxygen affinity of all chlorocruorins tested is considerably lower than that of most haemoglobins. But in Serpula the oxygen affinities of the chlorocruorin and haemoglobin are the same as one another. The carbon monoxide affinity of chlorocruorin (in Branchiomma) is higher than that of any haemoglobin. Although Serpulimorpha have chlorocruorin in their blood, the haem present in their tissues (muscles, eggs, sperm) is protohaem, not chlorocruorohaem. One genus, Potamilla, with chlorocruorin in its blood, has haemoglobin in the muscles. Chlorocruorin is known only from blood, and from the mucous tube of Myxicola; none has been found in cells.

The most statistically significant cluster at the \u223c2\u03c3 level contains four objects with H&lt;20 and all members have long observational arcs and concomitant good orbital elements. Despite the low statistical significance we performed several other tests on the cluster to determine if it is likely a genetic family. The tests included examining the cluster's taxonomy, size-frequency distribution, consistency with a family-forming event during tidal disruption in a close approach to Mars, and whether it is detectable in a proper element cluster search. None of these tests exclude the possibility that the cluster is a family but neither do they confirm the hypothesis.

{"abstract": "The presence of multiple populations (MPs) with distinctive light element abundances is a widespread phenomenon in clusters older than 6 Gyr. Clusters with masses, luminosities, and sizes comparable to those of ancient globulars are still forming today. None the less, the presence of light element variations has been poorly investigated in such young systems, even if the knowledge of the age at which this phenomenon develops is crucial for theoretical models on MPs. We use J-band integrated spectra of three young (7-40 Myr) clusters in NGC 4038 to look for Al variations indicative of MPs. Assuming that the large majority (\u226570 per cent) of stars are characterized by high Al content - as observed in Galactic clusters with comparable mass; we find that none of the studied clusters show significant Al variations. Small Al spreads have been measured in all the six young clusters observed in the near-infrared. While it is unlikely that young clusters only show low Al whereas old ones display different levels of Al variations; this suggests the possibility that MPs are not present at such young ages at least among the high-mass stellar component. Alternatively, the fraction of stars with field-like chemistry could be extremely large, mimicking low Al abundances in the integrated spectrum. Finally, since the near-infrared stellar continuum of young clusters is almost entirely due to luminous red supergiants, we can also speculate that MPs only manifest themselves in low-mass stars due to some evolutionary mechanism.", "title": ["Searching for globular cluster-like abundance patterns in young massive clusters - II.

{"abstract": "We develop a machine learning (ML) framework to populate large dark matter-only simulations with baryonic galaxies. Our ML framework takes input halo properties including halo mass, environment, spin, and recent growth history, and outputs central galaxy and halo baryonic properties, including stellar mass (M<SUB>*</SUB>), star formation rate (SFR), metallicity (Z), neutral (H I), and molecular (H_2) hydrogen mass. We apply this to the MUFASA cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, and show that it recovers the mean trends of output quantities with halo mass highly accurately, including following the sharp drop in SFR and gas in quenched massive galaxies. However, the scatter around the mean relations is underpredicted. Examining galaxies individually, at z = 0, the stellar mass and metallicity are accurately recovered (\u03c3 \u2272 0.2 dex), but SFR and H I show larger scatter (\u03c3 \u2273 0.3 dex); these values improve somewhat at z = 1 and 2. Remarkably, ML quantitatively recovers second parameter trends in galaxy properties, e.g. that galaxies with higher gas content and lower metallicity have higher SFR at a given M<SUB>*</SUB>. Testing various ML algorithms, we find that none perform significantly better than the others, nor does ensembling improve performance, likely because none of the algorithms reproduce the large observed scatter around the mean properties.

Many of these correlate strongly with one another, but it is not clear whether all of these measures probe the same intrinsic properties. In this work, we use two different statistical approaches - principal component analysis (PCA) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) - to investigate which dynamical properties of a cluster are in fact the best descriptors of its dynamical state. We use measurements taken directly from THE THREE HUNDRED suite of galaxy cluster simulations, as well as morphological properties calculated using mock X-ray and SZ maps of the same simulated clusters. We find that four descriptions of dynamical state naturally arise, and although correlations exist between these, a given cluster can be 'dynamically relaxed' according to all, none, or some of these four descriptions. These results demonstrate that it is highly important for future observational and theoretical studies to consider in which sense clusters are dynamically relaxed.

The three-dimensional carbon cycle model is based on the velocity field of the Hamburg Large-Scale Geostrophic Ocean General Circulation Model and uses the same grid as that model. The horizontal resolution (3.5\u00b0 \u00d7 3.5\u00b0) is lower than the length scale of narrow upwelling belts which could not be represented adequately in this study, but the large-scale features of the ocean carbon cycle are reproduced rather well. Sensitivity experiments were carried out to investigate the role of chemical and biological parameters (nutrient cycling, composition of biogenic particulate matter, CO<SUB>2</SUB> solubility) and different circulation regimes for the atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> content. The model responses were compared to deep-sea sediment core records and ice core data from the last glaciation.

Thus according to the model none of the scenarios tested proves to be completely acceptable. The residual discrepancies between the observed and modeled tracer records can probably be attributed to the as yet inadequate reconstruction of the glacial ocean circulation. It is therefore suggested that more effort should be devoted to realistically reproducing the ice age ocean circulation field making use of the forthcoming glacial radiocarbon data base. The residuals between the realistically modeled and observed carbon cycle tracers (\u03b4<SUP>13</SUP>C, CaCO<SUB>3</SUB> saturation) should then reveal more clearly the real cause for the observed pCO<SUB>2</SUB> decrease in the glacial atmosphere.", "title": ["Glacial pCO<SUB>2</SUB> Reduction by the World Ocean: Experiments With the Hamburg Carbon Cycle Model"], "year": "1991"}
{"abstract": "The very strong 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o was the first major event in which numerous forecasting groups participated in its real-time prediction. A previously developed simple statistical tool-the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation Climatology and Persistence (ENSO-CLIPER) model-is utilized as a baseline for determination of skill in forecasting this event. Twelve statistical and dynamical models were available in real time for evaluation. Some of the models were able to outperform ENSO-CLIPER in predicting either the onset or the decay of the 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o, but none were successful at both for a medium-range two season (6-8 months) lead time. There were no models, including ENSO-CLIPER, able to anticipate even one-half of the actual amplitude of the El Ni\u00f1o's peak at medium-range (6-11 months) lead. In addition, none of the models showed skill (i.e., lower root-mean-square error than ENSO-CLIPER) at the zero season (0-2 months) through the two season (6-8 months) lead times. No dynamical model and only two of the statistical models [the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and the constructed analog (ANALOG)] outperformed ENSO-CLIPER by more than 5% of the root-mean-square error at the three season (9-11 months) and four season (12-14 months) lead time. El Ni\u00f1o impacts were correctly anticipated by national meteorological centers one half-year in advance, because of the tendency for El Ni\u00f1o events to persist into and peak during the boreal winter. Despite this, the zero to two season (0-8 month) forecasts of the El Ni\u00f1o event itself were no better than ENSO-CLIPER and were, in that sense, not skillful-a conclusion that remains unclear to the general meteorological and oceanographic communities.", "title": ["How Much Skill Was There in Forecasting the Very Strong 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o?."], "year": "2000"}
{"abstract": "IGR J17591-2342 is a new accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar that was recently discovered in outburst in 2018. Early observations revealed that the source's radio emission is brighter than that of any other known neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) at comparable X-ray luminosity, and assuming its likely \u22736 kpc distance. It is comparably radio bright to black hole LMXBs at similar X-ray luminosities. In this work, we present the results of our extensive radio and X-ray monitoring campaign of the 2018 outburst of IGR J17591-2342. In total, we collected 10 quasi-simultaneous radio (VLA, ATCA) and X-ray (Swift-XRT) observations, which make IGR J17591-2342 one of the best-sampled NS-LMXBs. We use these to fit a power-law correlation index $\\beta = 0.37^{+0.42}_{-0.40}$ between observed radio and X-ray luminosities (L<SUB>R</SUB> \u221d L<SUB>X</SUB><SUP>\u03b2</SUP>).

We found no evidence for radio pulsations from IGR J17591-2342 in our Green Bank Telescope observations performed shortly after the source returned to quiescence.

{"abstract": "Two-dimensional models assuming axisymmetry are an economical way to explore the long-term evolution of black hole accretion disks, but they are only realistic if the feedback of the nonaxisymmetric turbulence on the mean momentum and magnetic fields is incorporated. Dynamo terms added to the 2D induction equation should be calibrated to 3D MHD simulations. For generality, the dynamo tensors should be calibrated as functions of local variables rather than explicit functions of spatial coordinates in a particular basis. In this paper, we study the feedback of non-axisymmetric features on the 2D mean fields using a global 3D, relativistic, Cartesian simulation from the IllinoisGRMHD code. We introduce new methods for estimating overall dynamo alpha and turbulent diffusivity effects as well as measures of the dominance of non-axisymmetric components of energies and fluxes within the disk interior. We attempt closure models of the dynamo EMF using least squares fitting, considering both models where coefficient tensors are functions of space and more global, covariant models.

We study whether this reflects orbital decay due to tidal dissipation in the star, or apsidal precession of a slightly eccentric orbit. In the latter case, a third body or other perturbation would be needed to sustain the eccentricity against tidal dissipation in the planet itself. We have analysed several such perturbative scenarios, but none is satisfactory. Most likely, therefore, the orbit really is decaying. If this is due to a dynamical tide, then WASP-12 should be a subgiant without a convective core as previous studies have suggested. We have modelled the star with the MESA code.

{"abstract": "According to classical tradition, Thales of Miletus predicted the total solar eclipse that took place on 28 May 585 BCE. Even if some authors have flatly denied the possibility of such a prediction, others have struggled to find cycles which would justify the achievement of the philosopher. Some of the proposed cycles have already been refuted, but two of them, namely those of Willy Hartner and Dirk Couprie, remain unchallenged. This paper presents some important objections to these two possibilities, based on the fact that these authors do not list all the eclipses potentially visible by their criteria. In addition, any explanation based on cycles will need to face the complex problem of visibility (smallest observable eclipse, weather...). The present article also includes a statistical study on the predictability of solar eclipses for a variety of periods, similar to that performed by Willy Hartner for lunar eclipses, resulting in lower probabilities in the solar case (and percentages depend on the chosen magnitude limit). The conclusion is that none of the cycles proposed so far provides a satisfactory explanation of the prediction, and, on statistical grounds, none of the periods studied leads to a significant probability of success with solar eclipse cycles.", "title": ["On the Eclipse of Thales, Cycles and Probabilities"], "year": "2013"}
{"abstract": "Passive Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging requires to reconstruct objects which cannot be seen in line without using external controllable light sources. It can be widely applied in areas like counter-terrorism, urban-Warfare, autonomous-driving and robot-vision. Existing methods for passive NLOS typically required extensive prior information and significant computational resources to establish light transport matrices or train neural networks. These constraints pose significant challenges for transitioning models to different NLOS scenarios. Thus, the pressing issue in passive NLOS imaging currently lies in whether it is possible to estimate the light transport matrices which corresponding to relay surfaces and scenes, as well as the specific distribution of targets, with a small amount of prior knowledge. In this work, we hypothesized a high-dimensional manifold and mathematically proved its existence. Within this high-dimensional manifold, the structural information of obscured targets is minimally disrupted. Therefore, we proposed a universal framework named High-Dimensional Projection Selection (HDPS) which can establish this high-dimensional manifold and output its projection onto corresponding surfaces on low-dimensional. HDPS can be applied to most mature network architectures and estimate the distribution of target and light spot obtained by camera with only minimal prior data. Certainly, with the help of the estimated information, it can establish a high-dimensional manifold consisting of target and input. As demonstrated in experiment, our framework, even when applied to the most basic network structures, can achieve higher accuracy results with significantly smaller amounts of prior data. Thereby, our approach enables passive NLOS scenarios to reconstruct target by limited prior data and computational resources.", "title": ["Passive None-line-of-sight imaging with arbitrary scene condition and detection pattern in small amount of prior data"], "year": "2024"}

Firstly, the CAM is embedded in the multilayer CNN to extract the time-domain data features of the original CIR.

In addition, the public dataset from the European Horizon 2020 Programme project eWINE is used to perform comparative experiments with different structural models and different identification methods.

Phanerochaete chrysosporium simultaneously degrades lignin and cellulose, whereas the closely related species, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, also depolymerizes lignin but may do so with relatively little cellulose degradation. To investigate the basis for selective ligninolysis, we conducted comparative genome analysis of C. subvermispora and P. chrysosporium. Genes encoding manganese peroxidase numbered 13 and five in C. subvermispora and P. chrysosporium, respectively. In addition, the C. subvermispora genome contains at least seven genes predicted to encode laccases, whereas the P. chrysosporium genome contains none. We also observed expansion of the number of C. subvermispora desaturase-encoding genes putatively involved in lipid metabolism. Microarray-based transcriptome analysis showed substantial up-regulation of several desaturase and MnP genes in wood-containing medium. MS identified MnP proteins in C. subvermispora culture filtrates, but none in P. chrysosporium cultures. These results support the importance of MnP and a lignin degradation mechanism whereby cleavage of the dominant nonphenolic structures is mediated by lipid peroxidation products. Two C. subvermispora genes were predicted to encode peroxidases structurally similar to P. chrysosporium lignin peroxidase and, following heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, the enzymes were shown to oxidize high redox potential substrates, but not Mn<SUP>2+</SUP>.

Here we propose a type of semimetals which hosts a single cone of Wilson fermions. The Wilson fermions possess linear dispersion near the Dirac point, but break the chiral or parity symmetry such that an unpaired Dirac cone can be realized on a lattice. In order to avoid the fermion doubling problem, the chiral symmetry or parity symmetry must be broken explicitly if the hermiticity, locality and translational invariance all hold.

{"abstract": "The paper presents practical considerations and guidelines for designing an improved-efficiency contactless inductive power transfer link, delivering DC power in step-down mode to an electromagnetic levitation melting system residing in a sealed compartment.

However, the output voltage of a system operating at such frequency remains influenced by the load to some extent, residing within a certain range with boundary values (minimum and maximum) corresponding to maximum (rated) and minimum load, respectively. Consequently, the proposed contactless power delivery system is first analyzed using both first harmonic approximation (frequency-domain) based approach and differential equations (time-domain) based method to obtain corresponding output voltage bounds.

{"abstract": "Recent experiments on walking droplets suggest an underlying connection between fluid dynamics and the quantum mechanics. Such experiments may be used to support the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory. In this paper we show that many quantum-like features of hydrodynamic excitations can be explained in the framework of the parametrically driven nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (DNLSE). It is shown that the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (NLSE) describes the pseudoquantum features of a given pseudoparticle in the Sagdeev pseudopotential just as the ordinary linear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (LSE) describes the quantum nature of real particles. The NLSE is shown to reduce to nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equation (NHJE) for the phase function of the complex wavefunction. The origin of the wave-particle dual-character in both LSE and NLSE is explained and basic similarities between the two models is highlighted. It is shown that many more pseudoquantum effects (yet to be explored) such as pseudoentanglement, self-interference effect and quantization of pseudoparticle energy are inherent features of classical fluids. Current investigation suggests that emergence of the quantum nature of fluids is independent from dynamics of the bouncing droplets or their interactions with the surface waves instantaneously created by them. In contrast to previous suggestions, it is remarked that intrinsically nonlinear collective excitations of a fluid can drive any particle even a pseudoparticle to behave quantum mechanically. These collective interactions in hydrodynamic model confirm the important nonlocal character (which is a key aspect of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory) of all the pseudoquantum phenomena.

The pH, phenolic content and glucose equivalents of the bark extracts were also related to spore germination. Bark samples from Acer pseudoplatanus, Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus robur and Tilia cordata were collected at two heights. We extracted water-soluble compounds and isolated fungal spore groups from Xanthoria parietina (L.) Th. Fr. in vitro on water agar mixed with extracts. Spores germinated and grew on pure water agar (control) and media with extracts from Acer, Betula and Fagus. Growth was significantly lower on Acer than on Betula, Fagus and controls. No germination took place on the remaining media suggesting a strong inhibitory effect of Fraxinus, Quercus, Tilia and Alnus. Germination occurred within a week and was an all-or-none response. The mycelia grew slowly, and diameters within 90 days ranged from 0.25 to 3.05 mm. All bark extracts that allowed germination showed a pH above 5.1 and relatively low amounts of phenols and glucose equivalents.

{"abstract": "It is a big challenge to develop efficient models for identifying personalized drug targets (PDTs) from high-dimensional personalized genomic profile of individual patients. Recent structural network control principles have introduced a new approach to discover PDTs by selecting an optimal set of driver genes in personalized gene interaction network (PGIN). However, most of current methods only focus on controlling the system through a minimum driver-node set and ignore the existence of multiple candidate driver-node sets for therapeutic drug target identification in PGIN. Therefore, this paper proposed multi-objective optimization-based structural network control principles (MONCP) by considering minimum driver nodes and maximum prior-known drug-target information. To solve MONCP, a discrete multi-objective optimization problem is formulated with many constrained variables, and a novel evolutionary optimization model called LSCV-MCEA was developed by adapting a multi-tasking framework and a rankings-based fitness function method. With genomics data of patients with breast or lung cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, the effectiveness of LSCV-MCEA was validated. The experimental results indicated that compared with other advanced methods, LSCV-MCEA can more effectively identify PDTs with the highest Area Under the Curve score for predicting clinically annotated combinatorial drugs. Meanwhile, LSCV-MCEA can more effectively solve MONCP than other evolutionary optimization methods in terms of algorithm convergence and diversity. Particularly, LSCV-MCEA can efficiently detect disease signals for individual patients with BRCA cancer.

{"abstract": "In indoor localization based on wireless sensor networks, due to the complex and changeable indoor environment, the propagation of wireless signals will be interfered by obstacles and walls to produce errors, which is called non-line-of-sight (NLOS) error. Although the probability data association (PDA) filtering algorithm is one of the most successful positioning algorithms in line-of-sight, the localization accuracy will be reduced and may lead to localization failure in the case of NLOS. To overcome this question, a modified hybrid filtering algorithm combining finite impulse response (FIR) filter and PDA filter is proposed. The FIR filter is used to recover the failed PDA filter, so as to alleviate the influence of NLOS on PDA filter location algorithm. The proposed FIR/PDA (FPDA) hybrid filter uses PDA filter and FIR filter as main filter and auxiliary filter respectively. Only when the PDA filter diverges, the auxiliary filter is enabled to generate state estimation and estimation error covariance and reset the main filter.

{"abstract": "Nowadays, ultra-wideband (UWB) technology is becoming a new approach to localize keyfobs in the car keyless entry system (KES), because it provides precise localization and secure communication. However, for vehicles the distance ranging suffers from great errors because of none-line-of-sight (NLOS) which is raised by the car. Regarding the NLOS problem, efforts have been made to mitigate the point-to-point ranging error or to estimate the tag coordinate by neural networks. However, it still suffers from some problems such as low accuracy, overfitting, or a large number of parameters. In order to address these problems, we propose a fusion method of a neural network and linear coordinate solver (NN-LCS). We use two FC layers to extract the distance feature and received signal strength (RSS) feature, respectively, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to estimate the distances with the fusion of these two features. We prove that the least square method which supports error loss backpropagation in the neural network is feasible for distance correcting learning. Therefore, our model is end-to-end and directly outputs the localization results. The results show that the proposed method is high-accuracy and with small model size which could be easily deployed on embedded devices with low computing ability.", "title": ["NN-LCS: Neural Network and Linear Coordinate Solver Fusion Method for UWB Localization in Car Keyless Entry System"], "year": "2023"}
{"abstract": "Distributed stochastic gradient descent is an important subroutine in distributed learning. A setting of particular interest is when the clients are mobile devices, where two important concerns are communication efficiency and the privacy of the clients. Several recent works have focused on reducing the communication cost or introducing privacy guarantees, but none of the proposed communication efficient methods are known to be privacy preserving and none of the known privacy mechanisms are known to be communication efficient. To this end, we study algorithms that achieve both communication efficiency and differential privacy. For $d$ variables and $n \\approx d$ clients, the proposed method uses $O(\\log \\log(nd))$ bits of communication per client per coordinate and ensures constant privacy. We also extend and improve previous analysis of the \\emph{Binomial mechanism} showing that it achieves nearly the same utility as the Gaussian mechanism, while requiring fewer representation bits, which can be of independent interest.", "title": ["cpSGD: Communication-efficient and differentially-private distributed SGD"], "year": "2018"}

[Nature (London) 446, 782 (2007)] raises questions about the role of the protein environment in protecting this coherence and the significance of the quantum coherence in light harvesting efficiency. In this paper we explore the applicability of the Redfield equation in its full form, in the secular approximation and with neglect of the imaginary part of the relaxation terms for the study of these phenomena. We find that none of the methods can give a reliable picture of the role of the environment in photosynthetic EET. In particular the popular secular approximation (or the corresponding Lindblad equation) produces anomalous behavior in the incoherent transfer region leading to overestimation of the contribution of environment-assisted transfer. The full Redfield expression on the other hand produces environment-independent dynamics in the large reorganization energy region.

In this work, we report on the first system with rapid decaying periods revealed by its optical and X-ray light curves, which has decreased from about one year to one month in three years.

{"abstract": "Aerosol indirect effects continue to constitute one of the most important uncertainties for anthropogenic climate perturbations. Within the international AEROCOM initiative, the representation of aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions in ten different general circulation models (GCMs) is evaluated using three satellite datasets. The focus is on stratiform liquid water clouds since most GCMs do not include ice nucleation effects, and none of the model explicitly parameterises aerosol effects on convective clouds. We compute statistical relationships between aerosol optical depth (\u03c4<SUB>a</SUB>) and various cloud and radiation quantities in a manner that is consistent between the models and the satellite data. It is found that the model-simulated influence of aerosols on cloud droplet number concentration (N<SUB>d</SUB>) compares relatively well to the satellite data at least over the ocean. The relationship between \u03c4<SUB>a</SUB> and liquid water path is simulated much too strongly by the models. This suggests that the implementation of the second aerosol indirect effect mainly in terms of an autoconversion parameterisation has to be revisited in the GCMs. A positive relationship between total cloud fraction (f<SUB>cld</SUB>) and \u03c4<SUB>a</SUB> as found in the satellite data is simulated by the majority of the models, albeit less strongly than that in the satellite data in most of them. In a discussion of the hypotheses proposed in the literature to explain the satellite-derived strong f<SUB>cld</SUB>-\u03c4<SUB>a</SUB> relationship, our results indicate that none can be identified as a unique explanation. Relationships similar to the ones found in satellite data between \u03c4<SUB>a</SUB> and cloud top temperature or outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) are simulated by only a few GCMs. The GCMs that simulate a negative OLR-\u03c4<SUB>a</SUB> relationship show a strong positive correlation between \u03c4<SUB>a</SUB> and f<SUB>cld</SUB>. The short-wave total aerosol radiative forcing as simulated by the GCMs is strongly influenced by the simulated anthropogenic fraction of \u03c4<SUB>a</SUB>, and parameterisation assumptions such as a lower bound on N<SUB>d</SUB>. Nevertheless, the strengths of the statistical relationships are good predictors for the aerosol forcings in the models. An estimate of the total short-wave aerosol forcing inferred from the combination of these predictors for the modelled forcings with the satellite-derived statistical relationships yields a global annual mean value of -1.5\u00b10.5 Wm<SUP>-2</SUP>. In an alternative approach, the radiative flux perturbation due to anthropogenic aerosols can be broken down into a component over the cloud-free portion of the globe (approximately the aerosol direct effect) and a component over the cloudy portion of the globe (approximately the aerosol indirect effect). An estimate obtained by scaling these simulated clear- and cloudy-sky forcings with estimates of anthropogenic \u03c4<SUB>a</SUB> and satellite-retrieved N<SUB>d</SUB>-\u03c4<SUB>a</SUB> regression slopes, respectively, yields a global, annual-mean aerosol direct effect estimate of -0.4\u00b10.2 Wm<SUP>-2</SUP> and a cloudy-sky (aerosol indirect effect) estimate of -0.7\u00b10.5 Wm<SUP>-2</SUP>, with a total estimate of -1.2\u00b10.4 Wm<SUP>-2</SUP>.", "title": ["Aerosol indirect effects - general circulation model intercomparison and evaluation with satellite data"], "year": "2009"}

The crop rotation was oilseed rape (OSR) - winter wheat - winter barley, while soil tillage (minimum tillage without ploughing, conventional tillage), application of pig slurry (none, application in autumn, application in spring, application in autumn plus in spring), mineral N fertilization (none, 120 or 240 kg N ha <SUP>-1</SUP> to cereals), and application of fungicides (none, intensive) were all varied. In each year the rotation and the treatments were located on the same plots. N leaching was calculated by multiplying the drainage volume with the respective N concentration obtained using ceramic suction cups. In all crops, N fertilization significantly increased the N balance in the order mineral N &lt; spring slurry &lt; autumn slurry. N leaching significantly correlated with the amount of percolation (P &lt; 0.05). Highest annual N losses occurred with wheat following OSR (73 kg N ha <SUP>-1</SUP>) compared to the situation with OSR following barley (44 kg N ha <SUP>-1</SUP>). Without slurry, mineral N fertilization increased N leaching only slightly, whereas slurry, especially if applied in autumn, boosted N losses. Soil tillage and fungicide application had no significant effect on N leaching, although the latter showed a large influence on N balance. Increasing N balance progressively raised N leaching in the subsequent period with all crops, however, only 13-25% of the N balance surpluses originating from the preceding crop seem to leave the system via this pathway. The results indicate only a poor correlation between N balances and N leaching. In the short-term, therefore, the N balance is not an appropriate indicator for the environmental impact of N fertilization. However, if set up over a longer period, N balances may still give good estimates of the leaching potential arising from different management systems.", "title": ["N balance as an indicator of N leaching in an oilseed rape - winter wheat - winter barley rotation"], "year": "2006"}

{"abstract": "Magnetic braking has a prominent role in driving the evolution of close low-mass binary systems and heavily influences the rotation rates of low-mass F- and later-type stars with convective envelopes. Several possible prescriptions that describe magnetic braking in the context of 1D stellar evolution models currently exist. We test four magnetic braking prescriptions against both low-mass X-ray binary orbital periods from the Milky Way and single-star rotation periods observed in open clusters. We find that the data favor a magnetic braking prescription that follows a rapid transition from fast to slow rotation rates, exhibits saturated (inefficient) magnetic braking below a critical Rossby number, and that is sufficiently strong to reproduce ultra-compact X-ray binary systems. Of the four prescriptions tested, these conditions are satisfied by a braking prescription that incorporates the effect of high-order magnetic field topology on angular momentum loss.

While it is expected that this unresolved force is balanced by the elastic response of the solid, a definitive analysis has remained elusive because of an apparent divergence of stress at the contact line. While a number of theories have been presented to cut off the divergence, none of them have provided reasonable agreement with experimental data. We measure surface and bulk deformation of a thin elastic film near a three-phase contact line using fluorescence confocal microscopy. The out-of-plane deformation is well fit by a linear elastic theory incorporating an out-of-plane restoring force due to the surface tension of the solid substrate. This theory predicts that the deformation profile near the contact line is scale-free and independent of the substrate elastic modulus.", "title": ["Deformation of an Elastic Substrate by a Three-Phase Contact Line"], "year": "2011"}

For each complex, the dissociation is probed for several values of E<SUB>a</SUB>, the available energy above the dissociation threshold. For NO-He, the E<SUB>a</SUB> values probed were 59, 172, and 273 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>; for NO-Ne they were 50 and 166 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>; and for NO-Ar they were 44, 94, 194, and 423 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The NO A \u223c state rotational distributions arising from NO-He are cold, with most products in low angular momentum states. NO-Ne leads to broader NO rotational distributions but they do not extend to the maximum possible given the energy available. In the case of NO-Ar, the distributions extend to the maximum allowed at that energy and show the unusual shapes associated with the rotational rainbow effect reported in previous studies. This is the only complex for which a rotational rainbow effect is observed at the chosen E<SUB>a</SUB> values. Product angular distributions have also been measured for the NO A \u223c photodissociation product for the three complexes.

{"abstract": "The energy requirements of gamma-ray bursts have in past been poorly constrained because of three major uncertainties: the distances to bursts, the degree of burst beaming, and the efficiency of gamma-ray production. The first of these has been resolved, with both indirect evidence (the distribution of bursts in flux and position) and direct evidence (redshifted absorption features in the afterglow spectrum of GRB 970508) pointing to cosmological distances. We now wish to address the second uncertainty. Afterglows allow a statistical test of beaming, described in an earlier paper. In this paper, we modify a standard fireball afterglow model to explore the effects of beaming on burst remnant dynamics and afterglow emission. If the burst ejecta are beamed into angle \u03b6<SUB>m</SUB>, the burst remnant's evolution changes qualitatively once its bulk Lorentz factor \u0393&lt;~1/\u03b6<SUB>m</SUB>: before this, \u0393 declines as a power law of radius, while afterward, it declines exponentially. This change results in a broken power-law light curve whose late-time decay is faster than expected for a purely spherical geometry. These predictions disagree with afterglow observations of GRB 970508. We explored several variations on our model, but none seems to be able to change this result. We therefore suggest that this burst is unlikely to have been highly beamed and that its energy requirements were near those of isotropic models. More recent afterglows may offer the first practical applications for our beamed models.", "title": ["The Dynamics and Light Curves of Beamed Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows"], "year": "1999"}

{"abstract": "Background: Important signaling properties, like adaptation, oscillations, and bistability, can emerge at the level of relatively simple systems of signaling proteins. Here, we have examined the quantitative properties of one well-studied signaling system, the JNK cascade. We experimentally assessed the response of JNK to a physiological stimulus (progesterone) and a pathological stress (hyperosmolar sorbitol) in Xenopus laevis oocytes, a cell type that is well-suited to the quantitative analysis of cell signaling. Our aim was to determine whether JNK responses are graded (Michaelian) in character; ultrasensitive in character, resembling the responses of cooperative enzymes; or bistable and all-or-none in character. <P />Results: The responses of JNK to both progesterone and sorbitol were found to be essentially all-or-none. Individual oocytes had either very high or very low JNK activities, with few oocytes possessing intermediate levels of JNK activity. Moreover, JNK activation was autocatalytic, indicating that the JNK cascade is either embedded in or downstream of a positive feedback loop. JNK also exhibited hysteresis, a form of biochemical memory, in its response to sorbitol. These findings indicate that the JNK cascade is part of a bistable signaling system in oocytes. <P />Conclusions: In Xenopus oocytes, JNK responds to physiological and pathological stimuli in an all-or-none manner. The JNK response shows all the hallmarks of a bistable response, including strong positive feedback and hysteresis. Bistability is a recurring theme in the biochemistry of oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis; the Mos/MEK/p42 MAPK cascade also exhibits bistable responses, and the Cdc2/cyclin B system is hypothesized to be bistable as well. However, the mechanisms underpinning the positive feedback and bistability in the three cases are different, suggesting that evolution has repeatedly converged upon bistability as a way of producing digital responses.", "title": ["Bistability in the JNK cascade"], "year": "2001"}
{"abstract": "RE J1034+396 is one of the most extreme narrow-line type 1 Seyfert galaxies detected thus far, showing the only quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) reliably detected in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Comparison with similar spectral and timing properties observed in the black hole X-ray binary (BHB) GRS 1915+105 suggests that RE J1034+396 is a super-Eddington accretor. A more complete understanding of the behaviour of RE J1034+396 can therefore lead to a unification of the accretion physics between such extreme AGN and super-Eddington BHBs. Here we report on our latest XMM-Newton observations of RE J1034+396, which no longer show the QPO, indicating that this source shows a non-stationary power spectrum. We use spectral and temporal analysis across all five XMM-Newton observations of the source to probe the evolution of the object. The combination of the shape of the fractional variability with energy and the inferred velocity of absorbing material in the line of sight rules out an absorption-only method of creating the QPO. Instead the periodically changing absorption may be produced by the QPO causing a change in ionization state. <P />We extend our analysis by including the covariance spectra which give much better signal-to-noise ratio than an rms spectrum. These reveal a new aspect of the QPO, which is that there is also a small contribution from a soft component which is hotter than the soft excess seen in the mean spectrum. Folding the light curve on the QPO period shows that this component lags behind the hard X-rays. If this is due to reprocessing, then the lag corresponds to a light traveltime across \u223c30R<SUB>g</SUB>. Some of the remaining observations have similar energy spectra and covariance spectra, but none of them shows a significant QPO, so we conclude that none of these features is the trigger for the appearance of the QPO in this object.", "title": ["Searching for the trigger of the active galactic nucleus quasi-periodic oscillation: 8 years of RE J1034+396"], "year": "2011"}

We examined both physiological (gas exchange) and morphological (biomass allocation, leaf properties) determinants of growth for these eight species under three steady-state drought treatments (none=control, moderate, and severe). When well watered, the grasses exhibited a large interspecific variation in growth, which was reflected in order-of-magnitude biomass differences after 5 weeks. The species had similar gas-exchange characteristics, but differed in all the measured allocation and morphological characteristics, namely tiller mass and number, root:shoot ratio, dry-matter content, and specific leaf area (SLA). Drought affected tillering, morphology, and allocation, and reduced growth by 50 and 68% (moderate and severe drought, respectively) compared to the well-watered controls. With the exception of SLA, none of these variables showed a significant species-by-treatment interaction. We calculated three indices of drought tolerance, defined as the ratio in final biomass between all the possible \"dry\"/\"wet\" treatment pairs: severe/moderate, moderate/control, and severe/control. We found no significant correlation between these drought tolerance indices, on the one hand, and three indices of growth potential (greenhouse RGR<SUB>max</SUB>, final biomass in the control treatment, and final:initial biomass ratio in controls), on the other.

We made use of the homogeneous set of observations of the polars by XMM-Newton to search for the presence of QPOs in the (0.5-10 keV) energy range and to set significant upper limits for the brightest X-ray polars. We extracted high time-resolution X-ray light curves by taking advantage of the 0.07 s resolution of the EPIC-PN camera. Among the 65 polars observed with XMM-Newton from 1998 to 2012, a sample of 24 sources was selected on the basis of their counting rate in the PN instrument to secure significant limits. We searched for QPOs using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods and defined limits of detection using statistical tools. Among the sample surveyed, none shows QPOs at a significant level. Upper limits to the fractional flux in QPOs range from 7% to 71%. These negative results are compared to the detailed theoretical predictions of numerical simulations based on a 2D hydrodynamical code presented in Paper II.

Our diagnostic technique allows a clear separation of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and starburst (SB) components in the observed mid-infrared emission, and a simple analytic model provides a quantitative estimate of the AGN/SB contribution to the bolometric luminosity. We show that AGN are ~30 times brighter at 6 \u03bcm than SBs with the same bolometric luminosity, so that even faint AGN can be detected. Star formation events are confirmed as the dominant power source for extreme IR activity, since ~85 per cent of ULIRG luminosity arises from the SB component. None the less an AGN is present in the majority (46/68) of our sources.", "title": ["Spectral decomposition of starbursts and active galactic nuclei in 5-8 \u03bcm Spitzer-IRS spectra of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies"], "year": "2008"}

In the present implementation, this is achieved by using the single-particle wave functions of the Transformed Harmonic Oscillator, which allows for an accurate description of deformation effects and pairing correlations in nuclei arbitrarily close to the particle drip lines. Method of solution: The program uses the axially Transformed Harmonic Oscillator (THO) single-particle basis to expand quasiparticle wave functions. It iteratively diagonalizes the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov Hamiltonian based on the Skyrme-forces and zero-range pairing interaction until a self-consistent solution is found. Restrictions on the complexity of the problem: Axial-, time-reversal-, and space-inversion symmetries are assumed. Only quasiparticle vacua of even-even nuclei can be calculated.

{"abstract": "We have studied emission of the four forbidden lines of atomic oxygen, \u03bb\u03bb 6364, 6300, 5577, and 2972 \u00c5 from a discharge through flowing tank oxygen at pressures of a few torricelli, in a tube of 8 mm i.d., with 40-120 mA of current flowing. We found that under these discharge conditions none of the lines were perceptibly broadened or shifted (to within 0.2 \u00c5), and that none showed any response to changes in conditions that would suggest collisional stimulation of emission. Hence we conclude that the emission of these lines is governed by their true radiative transition probabilities. Typical intensities were, for the four lines (in units of photons per cubic centimeter.second): 3.3\u00d710<SUP>9</SUP>, 1.0\u00d710<SUP>10</SUP>, 4.0\u00d710<SUP>10</SUP>, and 1.8\u00d710<SUP>9</SUP>, respectively.

{"abstract": "The timing of their entry into freshwater was found using otolith Sr:Ca ratios of 172 silver eels from the Hamana Lake system of central Japan, to be an important factor affecting whether or not Japanese eels (Anguilla japonica) later leave freshwater during their early growth phase. A high degree of phenotypic plasticity in migration and habitat use during their growth phase was found, with eels living in, or moving between, both freshwater and estuarine water. Of the 59% of the total eels that entered freshwater, 23% of those moved back to the brackish water lake within about 2 years. A higher proportion of river residents were females, but there were no significant differences in size, age, or growth at the start of their spawning migration among the different migratory types. None of the earliest eels to move into freshwater appeared to move back into the lake, and none of the eels that experienced the highest salinities at the time of recruitment appeared to enter freshwater. However, a large proportion of eels that arrived in freshwater later returned to the lake. This suggested that timing of arrival into freshwater may be an important factor determining which eels entering freshwater will remain there and which will make habitat shifts back to estuarine habitat.", "title": ["Influences of early habitat use on the migratory plasticity and demography of Japanese eels in central Japan"], "year": "2012"}
{"abstract": "Many marine sponge species contain bacterial symbionts within the intercellular matrix. However, direct evidence on when in the course of evolution these symbioses might have begun is not available. Sponge-specific bacterial strains (296) were isolated from 36 sponge species from the three major sponge classes collected from seven widely separate geographical regions. Strains resembling these sponge-specific ones were not found among 202 ambient water strains. A considerable proportion (40%) of the sponge-specific strains showed common antigens in agglutination reactions against immune sera prepared from seven of them, whereas none of the non-specific bacterial strains (94) and none of the seawater bacteria (34) agglutinated in these sera. Furthermore, the sponge-specific bacteria did not agglutinate with five antisera prepared from control, non-specific, bacterial strains. The establishment of symbioses is a rare and conservative event and immunological cross-reactions are usually considered to be highly specific. This evidence, supported by the knowledge of sponge evolution and of the sparse bacterial populations in hexactinellid sponges, suggests that the symbioses may have commenced during the Precambrian, before the evolution of the extant sponge orders and classes.", "title": ["Immunological Evidence for the Precambrian Origin of Bacterial Symbioses in Marine Sponges"], "year": "1984"}

We know that these ancient zircons yield relatively low crystallization temperatures and some are enriched in heavy oxygen, contain inclusions similar to modern crustal processes, and show evidence of silicate differentiation at 4.5 Ga. These observations are interpreted to reflect an early terrestrial hydrosphere, early felsic crust in which granitoids were produced and later weathered under high water activity conditions, and even the possible existence of plate boundary interactions\u2014in strong contrast to the traditional view of an uninhabitable, hellish world.

{"abstract": "Experimental I-V curves of superconducting MoGe nanowires show hysteresis for the thicker wires and none for the thinner wires. A rather quantitative account of these data for representative wires is obtained by numerically solving the one-dimensional heat flow equation to find a self-consistent distribution of temperature and local resistivity along the wire, using the measured linear resistance R(T) as input. This suggests that the retrapping current in the hysteretic I-V curves is primarily determined by heating effects, and not by the dynamics of phase motion in a tilted washboard potential as often assumed.

We probed for atmospheric homogeneity and time variability using the reflected light inferences for highly precise Kepler light curves of five hot Jupiters. We also investigated the scattering properties that constrain the most likely condensates in the inhomogeneous atmospheres. Cross validation prefers inhomogeneous albedo distributions for Kepler-7 b and Kepler-41 b, and a weak preference for inhomogeneity for KOI-13 b.

None of the tested independent variables of aboveground biomass density, latitude, temperature, precipitation, temperature:precipitation ratios, tree type, soil texture, and age had important explanatory value for R/S. However, linear regression analysis showed that aboveground biomass density, age, and latitudinal category were the most important predictors of root biomass density, and together explained 84% of the variation.

However, none of the work done to date has accounted for the effects of a surrounding geometrically thin disc on this precession, as would be the case in the truncated disc picture of the hard state. To address this, we perform a set of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of truncated discs misaligned with the spin axes of their central black holes. Our results confirm that the inner-hot flow still undergoes precession, though at a rate that is only 5 per cent of what is predicted for an isolated precessing torus.

This sheds light on a long-standing problem, wherein common density functional theory exchange-correlation functionals incorrectly predict that none of the low temperature experimentally characterized icelike wetting layers are thermodynamically stable.", "title": ["To Wet or Not to Wet?

{"abstract": "This study evaluates the accuracy of four different criteria to calculate the separation necessary to prevent seismic pounding between nonlinear hysteretic structural systems. All of the criteria considered in this paper make use of the same basic equation of the Double Difference Combination rule, but they adopt different procedures to estimate the correlation between displacement responses of nonlinear hysteretic systems. The seismic excitation was modeled as a nonstationary random process, and adjacent structures were modeled as 5%-damped bilinear hysteretic SDOF systems having a 5% post-yielding stiffness ratio. Results obtained through Monte Carlo simulations indicate that none of the criteria evaluated in this study is completely satisfactory in the sense that none of them can consistently provide \"exact\" or \"somewhat conservative\" results.", "title": ["Evaluation of current criteria in predicting the separation necessary to prevent seismic pounding between nonlinear hysteretic structural systems"], "year": "2009"}
{"abstract": "The dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the Milky Way are some of the most dark-matter-dominated objects known. Due to their proximity, high dark matter content, and lack of astrophysical backgrounds, dwarf spheroidal galaxies are widely considered to be among the most promising targets for the indirect detection of dark matter via \u03b3 rays. Here we report on \u03b3-ray observations of 25 Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies based on 4 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data. None of the dwarf galaxies are significantly detected in \u03b3 rays, and we present \u03b3-ray flux upper limits between 500 MeV and 500 GeV. We determine the dark matter content of 18 dwarf spheroidal galaxies from stellar kinematic data and combine LAT observations of 15 dwarf galaxies to constrain the dark matter annihilation cross section. We set some of the tightest constraints to date on the annihilation of dark matter particles with masses between 2 GeV and 10 TeV into prototypical standard model channels. We find these results to be robust against systematic uncertainties in the LAT instrument performance, diffuse \u03b3-ray background modeling, and assumed dark matter density profile.", "title": ["Dark matter constraints from observations of 25 Milky Way satellite galaxies with the Fermi Large Area Telescope"], "year": "2014"}

{"abstract": "The 29 estimators of natural mortality (M) that have been proposed for 'information-limited' fisheries are reviewed, together with a new alternative presented here. Each is applied to 13 example populations for which well-founded estimates are available of both M and the estimators' parameters. None of the 30 can provide accurate estimates for every species, and none appears sufficiently precise for use in analytical stock assessments, while several perform so poorly as to have no practical utility. If the growth coefficient K has been reliably estimated, either M = 1.5 K or Pauly's long-established estimator can provide useful estimates of M, but they fail with species that have long adult lives after swift juvenile growth, with those that never reach their asymptotic lengths and with species that otherwise deviate from archetypal teleost life histories. If a pre-exploitation maximum observed age (Tmax) can be established, M can be estimated for both teleosts and sharks using M = 4.3/Tmax but that seriously underestimates when the effective sample size (ne) is large and overestimates with species showing pronounced senescence. The new estimator presented here addresses ne but is upset by even mild senescence. Some estimators of M-at-size, particularly ones recently advanced by Gislason et al. and Charnov et al., also show promise but require further examination. It is recommended that fisheries scientists measure M by more advanced methods whenever possible. If 'information-limited' estimators must be used, their uncertainties should be acknowledged and their errors propagated into management advice.", "title": ["Natural mortality estimators for information-limited fisheries"], "year": "2014"}
{"abstract": "systematic survey of 3 years of L band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements of the Central American Volcanic Arc shows a striking lack of magmatic deformation. We make measurements at 20 of the 26 historically active volcanoes and demonstrate that none were deforming magmatically (2007-2010), although we do measure shallow subsidence associated with flow deposits and edifice loading at three volcanoes. The minimum detection rates for our survey, as estimated from the variance in time series of radar path delay, are relatively high due to strong variability of tropospheric water vapor. We compare the average detection threshold (2.4 cm/yr) to published InSAR measurements and show that the majority ( 78%) of deformation events would have been measurable with the same level of noise as Central America. We calculate that if magmatic volcano deformation were spread evenly across historically active volcanoes worldwide, the probability of none of Central America's 26 volcanoes deforming would be &lt; 1%. The lack of magmatic deformation in Central America may be indicative of differences in magma storage relative to other well-studied continental arcs. The high proportion of basalts that ascend directly from depth relative to andesites stored in the shallow crust may limit the potential for high magnitude deformation. Magma stored in vertically elongated reservoirs and high parental melt volatile contents that result in bubble-rich, compressible magmas at shallow depths may also reduce surface deformation. We consider the measurement and analysis of a lack of deformation at active volcanoes to be essential for realizing the potential of regional scale InSAR surveys.", "title": ["On the lack of InSAR observations of magmatic deformation at Central American volcanoes"], "year": "2013"}

Structural parameters [\u03bc<SUB>B</SUB>(0), \u03b1, r<SUB>25</SUB>, etc.] and colors (Johnson/Cousins U, B, V, I, &amp; R, when possible) were determined for the galaxies. The majority of these galaxies (80%) were well fit by an exponential profile, while the remaining were either fit by a king profile (17%) or were too clumpy to be fit by any curve (3%). None of the galaxies were fit by a de Vaucouleurs (1959) r<SUP>\u00bc</SUP>-type profile. The average central surface brightness of the sample is 23.06\u00b10.20 mag/arcsec<SUP>2</SUP>. The central surface brightness distribution of the galaxies is flat from 22.0\u03bc<SUB>B</SUB>(0) to 24.0\u03bc<SUB>B</SUB>(0), at which point a sharp dropoff is observed. By eliminating the possibility the dropoff is due to selection or distance effects, we show that it is highly likely the drop off is due to the inability for extremely LSB galaxies to form in the cluster environment. Finally, previous data have shown that LSBs are deficient in molecular gas and dust. If we assume that LSBs have no dust and correct the sample to face-on surface brightness, the lowest surface brightness disk we detected has \u03bc<SUB>B</SUB>(0)=27.1. However, this sample shows the same noncorrelation between inclination and central surface brightness that is seen for the case of high surface brightness galaxies. This noncorrelation has been used as an argument to support the notion that disk galaxies are optically thick. Since its extremely unlikely that LSBs are optically thick (i.e., none are IRAS sources) this noncorrelation most likely reflects the large intrinsic range of disk galaxy surface brightness instead of variations in disk galaxy opacity.", "title": ["A Wide Field CCD Survey for Low Surface Brightness Galaxies:I.Data Acquisition, Description, and Initial Results"], "year": "1997"}

{"abstract": "Hydrogeology has had an interesting evolution. In the early 20th century professionals faced the challenges of flow in porous media and well hydraulics; the emphasis was on quantity. Then in the second part of the century quality issues took over, and hydrogeologists faced geochemistry and transport of conservative solutes. Late in the 1980's the work turned to modeling and to stochastic hydrogeology. Since then new problems are incorporated every decade, now including (and by no means this is a complete list) surface/subsurface interactions, coastal aquifer dynamics, geothermal, vadose zone infiltration, multispecies reactive transport, CO2 sequestration, climate change, non-conventional resources related to integrated water management (e.g. reclaimed water), presence of emergent contaminants, risk evaluation,\u2026, and who knows what the future will bring. In short, most interesting problems involve hydro-bio-geo-chemical processes, most of them coupled and all of them extremely non-linear. But our \"clients\" want to read the results in ecological or toxicological terms. Furthermore there is the issue of heterogeneity which is present at all scales and that cannot be resolved, and on top of that uncertainty in the future possible scenarios. Yet, we are still providing solutions using very sophisticated codes that give one and only one answer, and we solve the problem by performing some sensitivity analysis.

{"abstract": "The existence of bright quasars at high redshifts implies that supermassive black holes were able to form in the early Universe. Though a number of mechanisms to achieve this have been proposed, none yet stands out. A recent suggestion is the formation of quasi-stars, initially stellar-mass black holes accreting from hydrostatic giant-like envelopes of gas, formed from the monolithic collapse of pre-galactic gas clouds. In this work, we modify the Cambridge STARS stellar evolution package to construct detailed models of the evolution of these objects. We find that, in all of our models, the black hole inside the envelope is able to reach slightly more than one-tenth of the total mass of the system before hydrostatic equilibrium breaks down. This breakdown occurs after a few million years of evolution. We show that the mechanism which causes the hydrostatic evolution to end is present in polytropic models. We also show that the solutions are highly sensitive to the size of the inner boundary radius and that no physical solutions exist if the inner boundary is chosen to be less than about 0.3 of the Bondi radius.", "title": ["The structure and evolution of quasi-stars"], "year": "2011"}
{"abstract": "Granular materials segregate. Small differences in either size or density lead to flow-induced segregation, a complex phenomenon without parallel in fluids. Modeling of mixing and segregation processes requires the confluence of several tools, including continuum and discrete descriptions (particle dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations, cellular automata computations) and, often, considerable geometrical insight. None of these viewpoints, however, is wholly satisfactory by itself. Moreover, continuum and discrete descriptions of granular flows are regime dependent, and this fact may require adopting different subviewpoints. This review organizes a body of knowledge that forms -- albeit imperfectly -- the beginnings of an expandable continuum framework for the description of mixing and segregation of granular materials. We focus primarily on noncohesive particles, possibly differing in size, density, shape, etc. We present segregation mechanisms and models for size and density segregation and introduce chaotic advection, which appears in noncircular tumblers.
