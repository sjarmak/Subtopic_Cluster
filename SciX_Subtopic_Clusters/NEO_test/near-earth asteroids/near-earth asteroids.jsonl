{"abstract": "It has become common practice in studies of the thermal emission from near-Earth asteroids to employ thermal models developed on the basis of infrared observations of large, main-belt asteroids. However, near-Earth asteroids are relatively small and are expected to have less dusty, \"rockier,\" surfaces with higher thermal inertias than main-belt asteroids. Furthermore, they tend to have irregular shapes and are often observed at large solar phase angles, compared to main-belt objects. Therefore, the applicability of the commonly used asteroid thermal models to these objects is not self-evident. Radiometric data in the 4-20-\u03bcm range of several near-Earth asteroids are compared with model predictions of the thermal emission. For all the objects considered both the \"standard\" and \"fast rotating\" thermal models produce poor fits to the observational data. Simple modifications to the standard thermal model are described that lead to significantly improved fits to the data. Revised estimates of the albedos and sizes of a number of near-Earth asteroids are derived using the resulting new thermal model with an empirically derived calibration parameter and compared with existing data from other sources. The new model is proposed as a default simple thermal model for estimating albedos and diameters of near-Earth asteroids.", "title": ["A Thermal Model for Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "1998"}
{"abstract": "Photometric data on 17 binary near-Earth asteroids (15 of them are certain detections, two are probables) were analysed and characteristic properties of the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) binary population were inferred. We have found that binary systems with a secondary-to-primary mean diameter ratio D/D\u2a7e0.18 concentrate among NEAs smaller than 2 km in diameter; the abundance of such binaries decreases significantly among larger NEAs. Secondaries show an upper size limit of D=0.5-1 km. Systems with D/D\u2a7d0.5 are abundant but larger satellites are significantly less common. Primaries have spheroidal shapes and they rotate rapidly, with periods concentrating between 2.2 to 2.8 h and with a tail of the distribution up to \u223c4 h. The fast rotators are close to the critical spin for rubble piles with bulk densities about 2 g/cm <SUP>3</SUP>. Orbital periods show an apparent cut-off at P\u223c11 h; closer systems with shorter orbital periods have not been discovered, which is consistent with the Roche limit for strengthless bodies. Secondaries are more elongated on average than primaries. Most, but not all, of their rotations appear to be synchronized with the orbital motion; nonsynchronous secondary rotations may occur especially among wider systems with P&gt;20 h. The specific total angular momentum of most of the binary systems is similar to within \u00b120% and close to the angular momentum of a sphere with the same total mass and density, rotating at the disruption limit; this suggests that the binaries were created by mechanism(s) related to rotation near the critical limit and that they neither gained nor lost significant amounts of angular momentum during or since formation. A comparison with six small asynchronous binaries detected in the main belt of asteroids suggests that the population extends beyond the region of terrestrial planets, but with characteristics shifted to larger sizes and longer periods. The estimated mean proportion of binaries with D/D\u2a7e0.18 among NEAs larger than 0.3 km is 15\u00b14%.

{"abstract": "We describe a methodology of estimating the size-frequency distribution (SFD) of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). We estimate the completion versus size of present surveys based on the re-detection ratio, that is, the fraction of all detections over a recent period that are re-detections of already discovered objects rather than new discoveries. The re-detection ratio is a robust measure of completion, but must be corrected for the obvious bias caused by differences in ease of discovery due to specific orbital geometries. We do this with a computer survey simulation using a large set of synthetic orbital elements matching as best possible the distribution of the real NEA population. Once suitably \"calibrated\" to match re-detections of the real survey, the completion estimate versus size derived from the simulation can be extended both to large size where few if any new detections are recorded, and to small sizes beyond where re-detection numbers are statistically significant, thereby providing an estimate of the population and survey completion over the entire range from the largest NEAs down to the smallest sizes detected (\u223c3 m diameter). Here we update our previous population estimates and survey progress, using discoveries by surveys from August, 2012 through July, 2014. We estimate that there are 990 \u00b1 20 NEAs larger than 1 km in diameter (absolute magnitude H \u2a7d 17.75), of which about 90% have been discovered as of August, 2014. We confirm a \"dip\" in the SFD, in the range from a few tens to a few hundreds of meters diameter, which may be due to the transition from larger \"rubble pile\" bodies to smaller \"monolithic\" bodies. We compare our population estimate at the smallest sizes with recent ones based on bolide frequency and find excellent agreement, within estimated errors. The same survey simulation methodology can be used to investigate population and survey completion of various subset populations, for example Earth-Crossing Asteroids (ECAs, with orbits crossing 1 AU heliocentric distance), Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs, with orbits passing within 0.05 AU of the Earth's orbit), or Interior to Earth Asteroids (IEOs, with orbits entirely interior to the Earth's orbit). Lastly, we have investigated the population and completion of so-called \"ARM-target\" asteroids, of size \u223c10 m diameter in orbits passing within 0.03 AU of the Earth's orbit with very low Earth-encounter velocity, &lt;2.5 km/s.

{"abstract": "Near-earth asteroids occur in three principle types of orbits: Amor, Apollo, and Aten. Amor asteroids make relatively close (within 0.3 AU) approaches to the earth's orbit, but do not actually overlap it. Apollo asteroids spend most of their time outside the earth's orbital path, but at some point of close approach to the sun, they cross the orbit of the earth. Aten asteroids are those whose orbits remain inside the earth's path for the majority of their time, with semi-major axes less than 0.1 AU. Near-earth orbit asteroids include: stones, stony-irons, irons, carbonaceous, and super-carbonaceous. Metals within these asteroids include: iron, nickel, cobalt, the platinum group, aluminum, titanium, and others. Focus is on the extraction of ferrous and platinum group metals from the stony-iron asteroids, and the iron asteroids. Extraction of the metal fraction can be accomplished through the use of tunnel-boring-machines (TBM) in the case of the stony-irons. The metals within the story-iron asteroids occur as dispersed granules, which can be separated from the stony fraction through magnetic and gaseous digestion separation techniques. The metal asteroids are processes by drilling and gaseous digestion or by gaseous digestion alone. Manufacturing of structures, housings, framing networks, pressure vessels, mirrors, and other products is accomplished through the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of metal coating on advanced composites and on the inside of contour-defining inflatables (CDI). Metal coatings on advanced composites provide: resistance to degradation in the hostile environments of space; superior optical properties; superior heat dissipation; service as wear coatings; and service as evidential coatings. Metal coatings on the inside of CDI produce metal load-bearing products. Fibers such as graphite, kevlar, glass, ceramic, metal, etc., can be incorporated in the metal coatings on the inside of CDI producing metal matrix products which exhibit high strength and resist crack propagation.", "title": ["Near-Earth asteroids: Metals occurrence, extraction, and fabrication"], "year": "1991"}

{"abstract": "The Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) program has applied electro-optical technology developed for Air Force Space Surveillance applications to the problem of discovering near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and comets. This application is natural due to the commonality between the surveillance of the sky for man-made satellites and the search for near-Earth objects (NEOs). Both require the efficient search of broad swaths of sky to detect faint, moving objects. Currently, the Air Force Ground-based Electro-Optic Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) systems, which operate as part of the worldwide U.S. space surveillance network, are being upgraded to state-of-the-art charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors. These detectors are based on recent advances made by MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the fabrication of large format, highly sensitive CCDs. In addition, state-of-the-art data processing algorithms have been developed to employ the new detectors for search operations. In order to address stressing space surveillance requirements, the Lincoln CCDs have a unique combination of features, including large format, high quantum efficiency, frame transfer, high readout rate, and low noise, not found on any commercially available CCD. Systems development for the GEODSS upgrades has been accomplished at the Lincoln Laboratory Experimental Test Site (ETS) located near Socorro, New Mexico, over the past several years. Starting in 1996, the Air Force funded a small effort to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CCD and broad area search technology when applied to the problem of finding asteroids and comets. This program evolved into the current LINEAR program, which is jointly funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and NASA. LINEAR, which started full operations in March of 1998, has discovered through September of 1999, 257 NEAs (of 797 known to date), 11 unusual objects (of 44 known), and 32 comets. Currently, LINEAR is contributing \u223c70% of the worldwide NEA discovery rate and has single-handedly increased the observations submitted to the Minor Planet Center by a factor of 10.

{"abstract": "The known near-Earth object (NEO) population consists of over 32,000 objects, with a yearly discovery rate of over 3000 NEOs per year. An essential component of the next generation of NEO surveys is an understanding of the population of known objects, including an accounting of the discovery rate per year as a function of size. Using a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) reference model developed for NASA's NEO Surveyor (NEOS) mission and a model of the major current and historical ground-based surveys, an estimate of the current NEA survey completeness as a function of size and absolute magnitude has been determined (termed the Known Object Model; KOM). This allows for understanding of the intersection of the known catalog of NEAs and the objects expected to be observed by NEOS. The current NEA population is found to be ~38% complete for objects larger than 140 m, consistent with estimates by Harris &amp; Chodas. NEOS is expected to catalog more than two-thirds of the NEAs larger than 140 m, resulting in ~76% of NEAs cataloged at the end of its 5 yr nominal survey, making significant progress toward the US Congressional mandate. The KOM estimates that ~77% of the currently cataloged objects will be detected by NEOS, with those not detected contributing ~9% to the final completeness at the end of its 5 yr mission.

{"abstract": "In this paper we update, extend, and improve upon the recent paper on Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) population by Harris and D'Abramo (2015). We update the population estimate taking into account discoveries to August 3, 2020. Shortly after the previous paper was published, we identified a problem in our previous studies due to rounding off of absolute magnitude H by the Minor Planet Center to 0.1 magnitude that implicitly shifted our bin boundaries by 0.05 magnitude. Here we correct the problem by choosing H bin boundaries at 0.25-0.75 magnitude, rather than 0.00-0.50 magnitude thereby eliminating the round-off shift. We also introduce an updated model distribution of NEA orbits (Granvik et al. 2018) in our survey simulations. This new population model includes orbital distributions as a function of size, allowing us to test our presumption that distributions are homologous with respect to size. The change in distribution of orbits between that used by Harris and D'Abramo (2015) and the newer Granvik et al. (2018) distributions was substantially greater than the range over size given in the latter, but made almost no difference in population estimates, suggesting that the re-detection algorithm is robust and does not depend strongly on the detailed orbit distribution, and also validates our presumption of homologous distribution over size. For the current analysis, we have added ATLAS and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to our analysis. We have separately analyzed the re-detection ratio versus size (H magnitude) for each of four surveys (Catalina + Mt. Lemmon, Pan-STARRS, ATLAS and ZTF) to investigate any differences between the various systems and cadences, and found none of significance, thus again, the re-detection algorithm appears very robust and mostly independent of survey parameters. With these changes and more recent discovery statistics to 2020, we estimate the number of NEAs of absolute magnitude H &lt; 17.75 (nominally D &gt; 1 km) to be 940 \u00b1 10. Following the updated population estimate, we examine more closely the rates of discovery of the largest NEAs (absolute magnitude H &lt; 17.75, nominally diameter D &gt; 1 km) to make a more detailed estimate of the numbers of these large objects that remain undiscovered. Lastly we use the distribution of albedos of NEAs from NEOWISE observations (Mainzer et al. 2011) to transform our population estimate from number versus H, N(&lt;H), to number versus D, N(&gt;D). Unfortunately this transformation depends substantially on only minor uncertainties in the albedo distribution, so N(&gt;D) remains much less certain than N(&lt;H).", "title": ["The population of near-earth asteroids revisited and updated"], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) offer insight into a size range of objects that are not easily observed in the main asteroid belt. Previous studies on the diversity of the NEA population have relied primarily on modeling and statistical analysis to determine asteroid compositions. Olivine and pyroxene, the dominant minerals in most asteroids, have characteristic absorption features in the visible and near-infrared (VISNIR) wavelengths that can be used to determine their compositions and abundances. However, formulas previously used for deriving compositions do not work very well for ordinary chondrite assemblages. Because two-thirds of NEAs have ordinary chondrite-like spectral parameters, it is essential to determine accurate mineralogies. Here we determine the band area ratios and Band I centers of 72 NEAs with visible and near-infrared spectra and use new calibrations to derive the mineralogies 47 of these NEAs with ordinary chondrite-like spectral parameters. Our results indicate that the majority of NEAs have LL-chondrite mineralogies. This is consistent with results from previous studies but continues to be in conflict with the population of recovered ordinary chondrites, of which H chondrites are the most abundant. To look for potential correlations between asteroid size, composition, and source region, we use a dynamical model to determine the most probable source region of each NEA. Model results indicate that NEAs with LL chondrite mineralogies appear to be preferentially derived from the \u03bd<SUB>6</SUB> secular resonance. This supports the hypothesis that the Flora family, which lies near the \u03bd<SUB>6</SUB> resonance, is the source of the LL chondrites. With the exception of basaltic achondrites, NEAs with non-chondrite spectral parameters are slightly less likely to be derived from the \u03bd<SUB>6</SUB> resonance than NEAs with chondrite-like mineralogies. The population of NEAs with H, L, and LL chondrite mineralogies does not appear to be influenced by size, which would suggest that ordinary chondrites are not preferentially sourced from meter-sized objects due to Yarkovsky effect.", "title": ["Mineralogies and source regions of near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2013"}

Our results are consistent with a trend of increasing albedo with decreasing size for S-type asteroids with diameters below 20 km. A number of objects are found to have unexpectedly low apparent color temperatures, which may reflect unusual thermal properties. However, the results from our limited sample suggest that high thermal-inertia, regolith-free objects may be uncommon, even amongst NEAs with diameters of less than 1 km.

{"abstract": "Thermal inertia determines the temperature distribution over the surface of an asteroid and therefore governs the magnitude the Yarkovsky effect. The latter causes gradual drifting of the orbits of km-sized asteroids and plays an important role in the delivery of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from the main belt and in the dynamical spreading of asteroid families. At present, very little is known about the thermal inertia of asteroids in the km size range. Here we show that the average thermal inertia of a sample of NEAs in the km-size range is 200\u00b140 JmsK. Furthermore, we identify a trend of increasing thermal inertia with decreasing asteroid diameter, D. This indicates that the dependence of the drift rate of the orbital semimajor axis on the size of asteroids due to the Yarkovsky effect is a more complex function than the generally adopted D dependence, and that the size distribution of objects injected by Yarkovsky-driven orbital mobility into the NEA source regions is less skewed to smaller sizes than generally assumed.

{"abstract": "We investigate the relevance of the Yarkovsky effect for the origin of kilometer and multikilometer near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). The Yarkovsky effect causes a slow migration in semimajor axis of main belt asteroids, some of which are therefore captured into powerful resonances and transported to the NEA space. With an innovative simulation scheme, we determine that in the current steady-state situation 100-160 bodies with H &lt; 18 (roughly larger than 1 km) enter the 3/1 resonance per million years and 40-60 enter the \u03bd <SUB>6</SUB> resonance. The ranges are due to uncertainties on relevant simulation parameters such as the time scales for collisional disruption and reorientation, their size dependence, and the strength of the Yarkovsky and YORP effects. These flux rates to the resonances are consistent with those independently derived by Bottke et al. (2002, Icarus 156, 399-433) with considerations based only on the NEA orbital distribution and dynamical lifetime. Our results have been obtained assuming that the main belt contains 1,300,000 asteroids with H &lt; 18 and linearly scale with this number. Assuming that the cumulative magnitude distribution of main belt asteroids is N(&lt; H) \u221d 10 <SUP>\u03b3' H</SUP> with \u03b3' = 0.25 in the 15.5 &lt; H &lt; 18 range (consistent with the results of the SDSS survey), we obtain that the bodies captured into the resonances should have a similar magnitude distribution, but with exponent coefficient \u03b3 = 0.33-0.40. The lowest value is obtained taking into account the YORP effect, while higher values correspond to a weakened YORP or to YORP-less cases. These values of \u03b3 are all compatible with the debiased magnitude distributions of the NEAs according to Rabinowitz et al. (2000, Nature 403, 165-166), Bottke et al. (2000b, Science 288, 2190-2194), and Stuart (2001, Science 294, 1691-1693). Hence the Yarkovsky and YORP effects allow us to understand why the magnitude distribution of NEAs is only moderately steeper than that of the main belt population.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) are excellent laboratories for processes that affect the surfaces of airless bodies. Most NEAs were not expected to contain OH/H<SUB loc=\"post\">2</SUB>O on their surfaces because they are primarily S-complex objects and sourced from the inner Main Belt, which is interior of the frost line, and their surface temperatures are high enough to remove these volatiles. However, a 3-\u03bcm feature typically indicative of OH/H<SUB loc=\"post\">2</SUB>O was identified on other seemingly dry bodies in the inner Solar System, such as the Moon and Vesta, and more recently on the NEAs (433) Eros, (1036) Ganymed, and (3122) Florence. The most likely sources for OH/H<SUB loc=\"post\">2</SUB>O on these bodies include carbonaceous chondrite impacts or interactions with protons implanted by solar wind. We investigated the causes of band depth and shape variations on NEAs by comparing new observations of Eros and Ganymed to those previously published and conducting a rotationally-resolved spectral study on Florence. All spectra discussed were collected by SpeX on NASA's IRTF using the LXD_short (1.67\u20134.2 \u03bcm) mode to characterize the 3-\u03bcm region.

All three asteroids possess exogenously sourced OH/H<SUB loc=\"post\">2</SUB>O and have spectra that show potential spatially correlated variations in band depth or shape. Eros' band is slightly wider at the poles than at lower sub-observer latitudes, possibly due to its high obliquity, which ensures that each polar region is oriented toward the Sun over a significant part of its orbit. Ganymed's trends in hydration band depth with sub-solar longitude and band I center suggest a carbonaceous or cometary impactor that struck the surface around 0\u00b0 relative longitude, excavating a relatively magnesium- and olivine-enriched layer. Florence's total hydrogen concentration remains stable across the surface even as the OH-to-H<SUB loc=\"post\">2</SUB>O ratio changes as the asteroid rotates.

To better understand what asteroid types a meteorite represents, it is crucial to identify the body they originated from. In this paper, we aim to determine possible parent bodies for the known meteorite falls among the known population of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). By using the similarity criterion D<SUB>N</SUB>, based on geocentric quantities, we found 20 possible NEA-meteorite pairs. By performing additional numerical simulations of the backward dynamics, we found that 12 of these pairs may be associated with a possible separation event from the progenitor NEA, while the remaining 8 pairs appear to be ambiguous or random associations. The most interesting are the Pribram and Neuschwanstein meteorites, which are dynamically associated with (482488) 2012 SW20 with a common separation age dating back to about 20-30 kyr ago, and the Motopi Pan meteorite, which has three candidate parent bodies: (454100) 2013 BO73, 2017 MC3, and 2009 FZ4. The average time of separation between our meteorite list and the progenitor body appears to be about 10 kyr, a time consistent with what is expected from the collision frequency of small NEAs. Based on our results, we suggest that about 25 per cent of meteorites do not originate in the main belt, but mainly from little collision events happening between NEAs in the inner Solar system.", "title": ["Identifying parent bodies of meteorites among near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2023"}
{"abstract": "The Yarkovsky effect is a thermal process acting upon the orbits of small celestial bodies, which can cause these orbits to slowly expand or contract with time. The effect is subtle ( $\\left\\langle {da}/{dt}\\right\\rangle \\sim {10}^{-4}$ au My<SUP>-1</SUP> for a 1 km diameter object) and is thus generally difficult to measure. We analyzed both optical and radar astrometry for 600 Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) for the purpose of detecting and quantifying the Yarkovsky effect. We present 247 NEAs with measured drift rates, which is the largest published set of Yarkovsky detections. This large sample size provides an opportunity to examine the Yarkovsky effect in a statistical manner. In particular, we describe two independent population-based tests that verify the measurement of Yarkovsky orbital drift. First, we provide observational confirmation for the Yarkovsky effect's theoretical size dependence of 1/D, where D is diameter. Second, we find that the observed ratio of negative to positive drift rates in our sample is 2.34, which, accounting for bias and sampling uncertainty, implies an actual ratio of ${2.7}_{-0.7}^{+0.3}$ . This ratio has a vanishingly small probability of occurring due to chance or statistical noise. The observed ratio of retrograde to prograde rotators is two times lower than the ratio expected from numerical predictions from NEA population studies and traditional assumptions about the sense of rotation of NEAs originating from various main belt escape routes. We also examine the efficiency with which solar energy is converted into orbital energy and find a median efficiency in our sample of 12%. We interpret this efficiency in terms of NEA spin and thermal properties.", "title": ["Yarkovsky Drift Detections for 247 Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2020"}

The study of NEOs is also important because of their potential hazard to the Earth. The investigation of small NEOs is challenging from Earth as they are observable only for a short time following their discovery and can sometimes only be reached again years or decades later. <BR /> Aims: We aim to derive the visible colors of NEOs and perform an initial taxonomic classification with a main focus on smaller objects and recent discoveries. <BR /> Methods: Photometric observations were performed using the 1.2 m telescope at the Haute-Provence observatory and the 1.0 m telescope at the Pic du Midi observatory in broadband Johnson-Cousins and Sloan photometric systems. <BR /> Results: We present new photometric observations for 55 NEOs. Our taxonomic classification shows that almost half (43%) of the objects in our sample are classified as S+Q-complex members, 19% as X-complex, 16% as C-complex, 12% as D-types, and finally 6% and 4% as A- and V-types, respectively. The distribution of the observed objects with H &gt; 19 and H \u2264 19 remains almost the same. However, the majority of the objects in our dataset with D &lt; 500 m belong to the \"silicate\" group, which is probably a result of an observational bias towards brighter and more accessible objects. \"Carbonaceous\" objects are predominant among those with a Jovian Tisserand parameter of Tj &lt; 3.

The synodic periods in the range 2.3-230 h were detected for 25 of them; 21 periods are new and in 4 cases we confirmed earlier determinations. In 20 cases the synodic periods are interpreted as being the rotation periods. Among the 5 exceptions, in two cases there remains an uncertainty whether the detected period is not half or twice that of the rotation period, and in another two cases-(3691) 1982 FT and 1997 BR-there were found large deviations of the lightcurve points from the mean curves that can be due to possible complex rotations of the small, slowly rotating asteroids. Overall, the short period end (2.3-3.3 h) of the spin rate distribution shows characteristics that are consistent with the hypothesis of their \u201crubble pile\u201d structure, as noted by Harris (LunarPlanet. Sci.XXVII, 493-494); specifically, there is a \u201cbarrier\u201d against spins faster than 2.3 h and the amplitudes of the fast rotating NEAs are smaller in comparison with the other, longer period NEAs. In the group of slow rotators (P&gt; 12 h), the suggested presence of objects in excited rotation states must be confirmed by further observations using also different techniques. This slow rotators group may be actually more abundant than our results suggest (6 of 25 objects, i.e., 20-30%), since there is a bias against low-amplitude slow rotators in the groundbased photometric program.", "title": ["Lightcurves of 26 Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "1998"}

The mineralogy and petrology of 17 near-Earth asteroids are characterized using reflectance spectroscopy with ground-based telescopes as one method to address their major issues. Implications for the origin and evolution are discussed in a separate paper. Assuming the surfaces are composed of cosmically abundant materials, the presence of certain mineralogical species can be determined from diagnostic absorption features and spectral characteristics which have been studied under known laboratory conditions and understood in terms of crystal field theory. With one possible exception, the surface composition of near-Earth asteroids consists of common rock-forming minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, and phyllosilicates. Opaque components are present but cannot be mineralogically identified with existing experimental data. The spectrum of 2201 Oljato cannot be interpreted in terms of common rock-forming minerals. This spectrum was examined for cometary features because its high orbital eccentricity suggests a possible relation to comets. No common cometary features are identified in its spectrum.

It will orbit the 20-km-diameter near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros for about 1 year, at a minimum orbit radius of about 35 km from the center of the asteroid. The NEAR is a solar-powered, three-axis stabilized spacecraft with a launch mass including propellant of 805 kg. NEAR uses X band telemetry to the NASA Deep Space Network, with the data rates at Eros up to 8.8 kbits/s using a 34-m High Efficiency (HEF) dish, and up to 26.5 kbits/s using a 70-m dish. A solid-state recorder is accommodated with a memory capacity of 1.8 Gbytes. Attitude control is to 1.7 mrad, line-of-sight pointing stability is within 50 \u03bcrad over 1 s, and post processing attitude knowledge is within 50 \u03bcrad. NEAR accommodates 56 kg of instruments and provides them with 84 W. The instruments are a multispectral imager (MSI), a near-infrared spectrograph (NIS), an X ray/gamma ray spectrometer (XRS/GRS), a magnetometer (MAG), and a laser rangefinder (NLR), while a radio science (RS) investigation uses the coherent X band transponder.

{"abstract": "Phase curves of asteroids are typically considered to depend solely on the scattering properties of airless particulate surfaces and the size of the object being studied. In this study, we demonstrate the additional dependence of phase curves on object shape, rotation pole orientation, and viewing geometry over an apparition. Variations in the phase curve of near-Earth asteroid (159402) 1999 AP10 over its apparition from 2020 July to 2021 January are verified to be due to aspect changes over the apparition. This is achieved through shape modelling of the asteroid and simulation of the phase curve over the apparition. We present simulations of asteroid phase curves over a range of geometries to understand the potential magnitude of this aspect effect, and under which circumstances it can begin to dominate in the phase curves. This dependence on aspect may introduce significant additional uncertainty in the properties derived from phase-curve data. We provide and demonstrate software code to estimate the aspect-related uncertainty in near-Earth asteroid phase curves through simulation and model fitting of a randomly generated sample of ellipsoidal asteroid models over the observed viewing geometry. We demonstrate how ignoring this effect may lead to misleading interpretations of the data and underestimation of uncertainties in further studies, such as those in the infrared that use phase curve derived parameters when fitting physical properties of an asteroid.", "title": ["The effect of aspect changes on Near-Earth Asteroid phase curves"], "year": "2022"}
{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroid 153814 (2001 WN5) was discovered on 2001 November 20 by the LONEOS survey. Based on its absolute magnitude of 18.3 (or diameter within a factor of two of 750 m) and minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) with Earth of less than 0.002 au, it was designated a potentially hazardous asteroid. This object was on the SENTRY list of possible Earth impactors until early 2002 when sufficient astrometry was collected to show previous potential impacts were no longer consistent with observations. Asteroid 153814 is of particular interest because it will make a very close flyby of Earth, within the orbit of the Moon, on 2028 June 26 at a distance of 0.65 lunar distances (250,000 km). Because this close approach occurs one year prior to the extremely close flyby of 99942 Apophis on 2029 April 13, asteroid 153814 is of interest as a possible rehearsal target for an Apophis observing campaign. Here, we will summarize the physical characterization of 153814 based on multiple apparitions of radar observations by Arecibo Observatory and infrared observations by the NEOWISE spacecraft. <P />Asteroid 153814 was observed with the Arecibo S-band (2380 MHz; 12.6 cm) planetary radar on 2010 October 29 and 30 providing Doppler-only, echo-power spectra and coarse ranging at a resolution of 600 m and again from 2019 August 21 to 25 providing additional echo-power spectra and coarse imaging at a resolution of 75 m. Four ranging measurements with precision on the order of 100 meters were reported. Additionally, NEOWISE observed 153814 at seven epochs between 2010 January 18 and 2020 January 23 with varying degrees of signal strength due to distances ranging from 0.1 to 1.8 au. We will present best estimates for the size, shape, spin state, and scattering properties of asteroid 153814. <P />In 2028, asteroid 153814 will become brighter than magnitude 22 by February 8 at ~90o solar elongation. It will remain at southern declinations, moving from -17o to -75o, through its close approach of 0.65 lunar distances. It will peak at brighter than magnitude 7, then fade as it moves to northern declinations. Such a close approach provides a very accessible target for optical lightcurve and spectroscopic observations as well as an extremely strong radar target. Although too far south during the exact moment of closest approach, 153814 will be observable by the Goldstone (DSS-14; 70 m) radar from mid-June to June 24 and then again just after close approach on June 26 into early July, allowing for high-resolution imaging as fine as meters per pixel. A similar viewing opportunity, narrowly missing the exact moment of closest approach, is available to the Green Bank Telescope, which is working on its own radar transmit capability. The far, southern declination of the close approach will be ideal for a southern hemisphere radar such as on the Canberra (DSS-43; 70 m) Deep Space Network antenna. Meanwhile, 153814 will be detectable by NEO Surveyor at multiple epochs between the beginning of its survey and the 2028 close flyby of Earth.", "title": ["Characterization of Near-Earth Asteroid 153814 (2001 WN5) and Prospects for the 2028 Close Encounter with Earth"], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "Numerical modeling has long suggested that gravitationally bound (or so-called rubble-pile) near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) can be destroyed by tidal forces during close and slow encounters with terrestrial planets. However, tidal disruptions of NEAs have never been directly observed nor have they been directly attributed to any families of NEAs. Here we show population-level evidence for the tidal disruption of NEAs during close encounters with Earth and Venus. Debiased model distributions of NEA orbits and absolute magnitudes based on observations by the Catalina Sky Survey during 2005-2012 underpredict the number of NEAs with perihelion distances coinciding with the semimajor axes of Venus and Earth. A detailed analysis of the orbital distributions of the excess NEAs shows that their characteristics agree with the prediction for tidal disruptions, and they cannot be explained by observational selection effects or orbital dynamics. Accounting for tidal disruptions in evolutionary models of the NEA population partly bridges the gap between the predicted rate of impacts by asteroids with diameters of tens of meters and observed statistics of fireballs in the same size range.", "title": ["Tidal Disruption of Near-Earth Asteroids during Close Encounters with Terrestrial Planets"], "year": "2024"}

We utilized the complete astrometric dataset from the MPC, encompassing all radar data and Gaia DR3 observations. The orbital computation was performed for a total of 446 Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs; including 93 Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)), and 54094 Inner Main Belt Asteroids (IMBAs) as well as Mars Crossing asteroids.

{"abstract": "On February 14, 2000, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft (NEAR Shoemaker) began the first orbital study of an asteroid, the near-Earth object 433 Eros. Almost a year later, on February 12, 2001, NEAR Shoemaker completed its mission by landing on the asteroid and acquiring data from its surface. NEAR Shoemaker's intensive study has found an average density of 2.67 \u00b1 0.03, almost uniform within the asteroid. Based upon solar fluorescence X-ray spectra obtained from orbit, the abundance of major rock-forming elements at Eros may be consistent with that of ordinary chondrite meteorites except for a depletion in S. Such a composition would be consistent with spatially resolved, visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectra of the surface. Gamma-ray spectra from the surface show Fe to be depleted from chondritic values, but not K. Eros is not a highly differentiated body, but some degree of partial melting or differentiation cannot be ruled out. No evidence has been found for compositional heterogeneity or an intrinsic magnetic field. The surface is covered by a regolith estimated at tens of meters thick, formed by successive impacts. Some areas have lesser surface age and were apparently more recently disturbed or covered by regolith. A small center of mass offset from the center of figure suggests regionally nonuniform regolith thickness or internal density variation. Blocks have a nonuniform distribution consistent with emplacement of ejecta from the youngest large crater. Some topographic features indicate tectonic deformations. Several regional-scale linear features have related orientations, suggesting a globally consolidated internal structure. Structural control of crater shapes hints that such internal structure is pervasive. From the bulk density, inferred composition, and evidence for global structure, Eros is interpreted to be largely intact but extensively fractured.", "title": ["Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous: Mission Summary"], "year": "2002"}
{"abstract": "We analyze the dynamical evolution of Jupiter-family (JF) comets and near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) with aphelion distances Q&gt;3.5 AU, paying special attention to the problem of mixing of both populations, such that inactive comets may be disguised as NEAs.

We also analyze the problem of decoupling JF comets from Jupiter to produce Encke-type comets. To this end we simulate the dynamical evolution of the sample of observed JF comets with the inclusion of nongravitational forces. While decoupling occurs very seldom when a purely gravitational motion is considered, the action of nongravitational forces (as strong as or greater than those acting on Encke) can produce a few Enckes. Furthermore, a few JF comets are transferred to low-eccentricity orbits entirely within the main asteroid belt ( Q&lt;4 AU and q&gt;2 AU). The population of NEAs in cometary orbits is found to be adequately replenished with NEAs of smaller Q's diffusing outward, from which we can set an upper limit of \u223c20% for the putative component of deactivated JF comets needed to maintain such a population in steady state. From this analysis, the upper limit for the average time that a JF comet in near-Earth orbit can spend as a dormant, asteroid-looking body can be estimated to be about 40% of the time spent as an active comet.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon exhibits activity during its perihelion passage at 0.14 au from the Sun and is the likely parent body of the annual Geminid meteor shower. Its low albedo and featureless B-type reflectance spectrum indicate a primitive composition, but a definitive meteorite analogue is currently indeterminate. Here we analyse a mid-infrared emissivity spectrum of Phaethon and find that it most closely matches the Yamato group (CY) of carbonaceous chondrites. The CY chondrites experienced aqueous alteration and recent thermal metamorphism in which extreme temperatures caused mineral decomposition, resulting in the production of gas species. Temperatures within Phaethon during its close approach to the Sun are conducive to the thermal decomposition of carbonates, iron sulfides and phyllosilicates that release CO<SUB>2</SUB>, S<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O gas, respectively. Spectral detection of these minerals strongly implies that gas release from mineral decomposition is capable of triggering dust ejection.

{"abstract": "<BR /> Aims: In this paper we establish a compositional and dynamical connection between two B-type objects: main belt asteroid (2) Pallas and near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon. The final purpose is to help understand the origin of this very interesting object. <BR /> Methods: We first compare visible and near-infrared spectra of asteroids Phaethon and Pallas. We then compare the reflectance spectra of Phaethon with all the available visible spectra of B-type asteroids belonging to the Pallas family. One last spectral comparison is then performed to search for any correspondence between Phaethon and any B-type asteroid in the main belt. Numerical simulations are also carried out to explore the dynamical connection between the orbital neighborhoods of Pallas and Phaethon. <BR /> Results: Main differences between Phaethon and Pallas lie in the visible wavelength part of their reflectance spectra. We have also found that the nine asteroids belonging to the Pallas family have visible spectra that are different from that of Pallas and strikingly similar to that of Phaethon. Spectral comparison excludes any other B-type asteroid in the main belt as a possible parent body of Phaethon. Numerical simulations establish a dynamical pathway that connects Phaethon with Pallas and its family members. <BR /> Conclusions: The spectral similarities between Phaethon and Pallas family members, together with their established dynamical connection, supports Pallas as the most likely parent body of Phaethon and therefore, the associated Geminids meteor stream. We suggest that differences in asteroid sizes are the most likely explanation for the differences in the visible reflectance spectra between Phaethon and Pallas.", "title": ["Origin of the near-Earth asteroid Phaethon and the Geminids meteor shower"], "year": "2010"}
{"abstract": "Small asteroids intersecting Earth's orbit can deliver extraterrestrial rocks to Earth, called meteorites. This process is accompanied by a luminous phenomena in the atmosphere called bolides or fireballs. Observations of bolides provide pre-atmospheric orbits of meteorites, physical and chemical properties of small asteroids, and the flux (i.e., frequency of impacts) of bodies at Earth in the centimeter to decameter size range. In this chapter we explain the processes occurring during the penetration of cosmic bodies through the atmosphere and review the methods of bolide observations. We compile available data on the fireballs associated with 22 instrumentally observed meteorite falls.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) have struck the Earth throughout its existence. During epochs when life was gaining a foothold \u223c4 Ga, the impact rate was thousands of times what it is today. Even during the Phanerozoic, the numbers of NEAs guarantee that there were other impacts, possibly larger than the Chicxulub event, which was responsible for the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinctions. Astronomers have found over 2500 NEAs of all sizes, including well over half of the estimated 1100 NEAs &gt;1 km diameter. NEAs are mostly collisional fragments from the inner half of the asteroid belt and range in composition from porous, carbonaceous-chondrite-like to metallic. Nearly one-fifth of them have satellites or are double bodies. When the international telescopic Spaceguard Survey, which has a goal of discovering 90% of NEAs &gt;1 km diameter, is completed, perhaps as early as 2008, nearly half of the remaining impact hazard will be from land or ocean impacts by bodies 70-600 m diameter. (Comets are expected to contribute only about 1% of the total risk.) The consequences of impacts for civilization are potentially enormous, but impacts are so rare that worldwide mortality from impacts will have dropped to only about 150 per year (averaged over very long durations) after the Spaceguard goal has, presumably, ruled out near-term impacts by 90% of the most dangerous ones; that is, in the mid-range between very serious causes of death (disease, auto accidents) and minor but frightening ones (like shark attacks). Differences in perception concerning this rather newly recognized hazard dominate evaluation of its significance.

{"abstract": "The Yarkovsky effect is a subtle nongravitational phenomenon related to the anisotropic thermal emission of Solar System objects. Its importance has been recently demonstrated in relation to the transport of material from the main asteroid belt (both to explain the origin of near-Earth asteroids and some properties of meteorites) and also in relation to the aging processes of the asteroid families. However, unlike the case of the artificial satellites, the Yarkovsky effect has never been measured or detected in the motion of natural bodies in the Solar System. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting the Yarkovsky effect via precise orbit determination of near-Earth asteroids. Such a detection is feasible only with the existence of precise radar astrometry at multiple apparitions. Since the observability of the Yarkovsky perturbation accumulates quadratically with time the time span between radar observations is a critical factor. Though the current data do not clearly indicate the Yarkovsky effect in the motion of these bodies, we predict that the next apparition of several asteroids (in particular, 6489 Golevka, 1620 Geographos, and possibly 1566 Icarus) might reveal its existence. Moreover, we show that the Yarkovsky effect may play a very important role in the orbit determination of small, but still observable, bodies like 1998 KY <SUB>26</SUB>.

{"abstract": "Between 2010 and 2017, we have collected new optical and radar observations of the potentially hazardous asteroid (2102) Tantalus from the ESO NTT and Danish telescopes at the La Silla Observatory, and from the Arecibo planetary radar. The object appears to be nearly spherical, showing a low-amplitude light-curve variation and limited large-scale features in the radar images. The spin-state is difficult to constrain with the available data; including a certain light-curve subset significantly changes the spin-state estimates, and the uncertainties on period determination are significant. Constraining any change in rotation rate was not possible, despite decades of observations. The convex light curve-inversion model, with rotational pole at \u03bb = 210\u00b0 \u00b1 41\u00b0 and \u03b2 = -30\u00b0 \u00b1 35\u00b0, is more flattened than the two models reconstructed by including radar observations: with prograde (\u03bb = 36\u00b0 \u00b1 23\u00b0, \u03b2 = 30\u00b0 \u00b1 15\u00b0), and with retrograde rotation mode (\u03bb = 180\u00b0 \u00b1 24\u00b0, \u03b2 = -30 \u00b1 16\u00b0).

Radar measurements indicate possible variation in surface properties, suggesting one side might have lower radar albedo and be rougher at the centimetre-to-decimetre scale than the other. However, further observations are needed to confirm this.

This object rotates in just about 34 s, and a large Yarkovsky effect has been determined from astrometry. By using these results, we aim to constrain the thermal inertia of the surface of this extreme object. <BR /> Methods: We used a recently developed statistical method to determine the thermal properties of near-Earth asteroids.

{"abstract": "Fifteen orbital clusters (associations) were identified among ${\\sim }20\\, 000$ near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). All associations were found with a high statistical reliability using a single linkage cluster analysis algorithm and three orbital similarity functions. The identified groups constitute a small fraction (4.74 per cent) of the entire sample. Notwithstanding, they may be hazardous to Earth and its inhabitants. As with meteoroid streams, every year Earth comes very close to the orbits of each association. In two cases (2008TC3 and 2017FU102), the distance between the asteroid's orbit and Earth's orbit was shorter than Earth's radius. Among the members of the identified associations, we found 331 objects larger than the Chelyabinsk asteroid and all of them approach Earth's orbit at a distance smaller than 0.05 au. Two of the identified groups, (4179) Toutatis and (251430) Itokawa, support the hypothesis regarding the catastrophic origins of the asteroids Toutatis and Itokawa through violent collisions. This study does not focus on the origin of the NEA associations, but rather focuses on tracing the associations. Regardless of their origin, the identified groups pose a serious threat to Earth.

{"abstract": "Dynamical resonances in the asteroid belt are the gateway for the production of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). To generate the observed number of NEAs, however, requires the injection of many asteroids into those resonant regions. Collisional processes have long been claimed as a possible source, but difficulties with that idea have led to the suggestion that orbital drift arising from the Yarkovsky effect dominates the injection process. (The Yarkovsky effect is a force arising from differential heating-the `afternoon' side of an asteroid is warmer than the `morning' side.) The two models predict different rotational properties of NEAs: the usual collisional theories are consistent with a nearly isotropic distribution of rotation vectors, whereas the `Yarkovsky model' predicts an excess of retrograde rotations. Here we report that the spin vectors of NEAs show a strong and statistically significant excess of retrograde rotations, quantitatively consistent with the theoretical expectations of the Yarkovsky model.", "title": ["Retrograde spins of near-Earth asteroids from the Yarkovsky effect"], "year": "2004"}

{"abstract": "The discovery of 1991 VG on 1991 November 6 attracted an unprecedented amount of attention as it was the first near-Earth object (NEO) ever found on an Earth-like orbit. At that time, it was considered by some as the first representative of a new dynamical class of asteroids, while others argued that an artificial (terrestrial or extraterrestrial) origin was more likely. Over a quarter of a century later, this peculiar NEO has been recently recovered and the new data may help in confirming or ruling out early theories about its origin. Here, we use the latest data to perform an independent assessment of its current dynamical status and short-term orbital evolution. Extensive N-body simulations show that its orbit is chaotic on time-scales longer than a few decades. We confirm that 1991 VG was briefly captured by Earth's gravity as a minimoon during its previous fly-by in 1991-1992; although it has been a recurrent transient co-orbital of the horseshoe type in the past and it will return as such in the future, it is not a present-day co-orbital companion of the Earth.

The DART spacecraft will impact the satellite, causing changes in the binary orbit that will be measured by Earth-based observers. We observed Didymos using the planetary radars at Arecibo (2380 MHz, 12.6 cm) and Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) in November 2003. Delay-Doppler radar imaging of the binary system provided range resolutions of up to 15 m/pixel that placed hundreds of pixels on the primary. We used the radar data to estimate a 3D shape model and spin state for the primary, the secondary size and spin, the mutual orbit parameters, and the radar scattering properties of the binary system. We included lightcurves obtained by Pravec et al. (2006) in the shape model estimation. The primary is top-shaped with an equatorial bulge, a conspicuous facet along the equator, and a volume-equivalent diameter of 780 \u00b1 30 m. The extents along the three principal axes are 832 m, 838 m, and 786 m, (uncertainties are 6% along the x and y axes, and 10% along the z axis). The radar data do not provide complete rotational coverage of the secondary but show visible extents of about 75 m, implying a diameter of 150 \u00b1 30 m. The bandwidth of the secondary in the images suggests a spin period of 12.4 \u00b1 3.0 h that is consistent with rotation that is synchronized with the mutual orbit period of 11.9 h. We fit a mutual orbit to the system using the delay and Doppler separations between the binary components and obtain a semimajor axis of 1190 \u00b1 30 m, an eccentricity of &lt;0.05, and an orbital period of 11.93 \u00b1 0.01 h that are consistent with those obtained by Scheirich and Pravec (2009) and Fang and Margot (2012).

{"abstract": "We present an approach that significantly increases the sensitivity for finding and tracking small and fast near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). This approach relies on a combined use of a new generation of high-speed cameras which allow short, high frame-rate exposures of moving objects, effectively \"freezing\" their motion, and a computationally enhanced implementation of the \"shift-and-add\" data processing technique that helps to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detection of NEAs. The SNR of a single short exposure of a dim NEA is insufficient to detect it in one frame, but by computationally searching for an appropriate velocity vector, shifting successive frames relative to each other and then co-adding the shifted frames in post-processing, we synthetically create a long-exposure image as if the telescope were tracking the object. This approach, which we call \"synthetic tracking,\" enhances the familiar shift-and-add technique with the ability to do a wide blind search, detect, and track dim and fast-moving NEAs in near real time. We discuss also how synthetic tracking improves the astrometry of fast-moving NEAs. We apply this technique to observations of two known asteroids conducted on the Palomar 200 inch telescope and demonstrate improved SNR and 10 fold improvement of astrometric precision over the traditional long-exposure approach.

The presence of orbiting particles in the system is likely for most of the estimated range of values for mass and volume. The spatial mass density of ejected material is calculated for different particle sizes and at different heliocentric orbit epochs, revealing that large particles dominate the mass density distribution and that small particle abundance depends on observation epoch.

{"abstract": "While computing an improved near-Earth object (NEO) steady-state orbital distribution model, we discovered in the numerical integrations the unexpected production of retrograde orbits for asteroids that had originally exited from the accepted main-belt source regions.

These rare outcomes typically happen when asteroid orbits flip to a retrograde configuration while in the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter and then live for ~0.001 to 100 Myr. The model predicts, given the estimated near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population, that a few retrograde 0.1-1 km NEAs should exist. Currently, there are two known MPC NEOs with asteroidal designations on retrograde orbits which we therefore claim could be escaped asteroids instead of devolatilized comets.

{"abstract": "Phase reddening is an effect that produces an increase of the spectral slope and variations in the strength of the absorption bands as the phase angle increases. In order to understand its effect on spectroscopic observations of asteroids, we have analyzed the visible and near-infrared spectra (0.45-2.5 \u03bcm) of 12 near-Earth asteroids observed at different phase angles. All these asteroids are classified as either S-complex or Q-type asteroids. In addition, we have acquired laboratory spectra of three different types of ordinary chondrites at phase angles ranging from 13\u00b0 to 120\u00b0. We have found that both, asteroid and meteorite spectra show an increase in band depths with increasing phase angle. In the case of the asteroids the Band I depth increases in the range of \u223c2\u00b0 &lt; g &lt; 70\u00b0 and the Band II depth increases in the range of \u223c2\u00b0 &lt; g &lt; 55\u00b0. Using this information we have derived equations that can be used to correct the effect of phase reddening in the band depths. Of the three meteorite samples, the (olivine-rich) LL6 ordinary chondrite is the most affected by phase reddening. The studied ordinary chondrites have their maximum spectral contrast of Band I depths at a phase angle of \u223c60\u00b0, followed by a decrease between 60\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 phase angle. The Band II depths of these samples have their maximum spectral contrast at phase angles of 30-60\u00b0 which then gradually decreases to 120\u00b0 phase angle. The spectral slope of the ordinary chondrites spectra shows a significant increase with increasing phase angle for g &gt; 30\u00b0. Variations in band centers and band area ratio (BAR) values were also found, however they seems to have no significant impact on the mineralogical analysis. Our study showed that the increase in spectral slope caused by phase reddening is comparable to certain degree of space weathering. In particular, an increase in phase angle in the range of 30-120\u00b0 will produce a reddening of the reflectance spectra equivalent to exposure times of \u223c0.1 \u00d7 10<SUP>6</SUP>-1.3 \u00d7 10<SUP>6</SUP> years at about 1 AU from the Sun.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroid, Kamo'oalewa (469219), is one of a small number of known quasi-satellites of Earth; it transitions between quasi-satellite and horseshoe orbital states on centennial timescales, maintaining this dynamics over megayears. The similarity of its reflectance spectrum to lunar silicates and its Earth-like orbit both suggest that it originated from the lunar surface. Here we carry out numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of particles launched from different locations on the lunar surface with a range of ejection velocities in order to assess the hypothesis that Kamo`oalewa originated as a debris-fragment from a meteoroidal impact with the lunar surface. As these ejecta escape the Earth-Moon environment, they face a dynamical barrier for entry into Earth's co-orbital space. However, a small fraction of launch conditions yields outcomes that are compatible with Kamo`oalewa's orbit. The most favored conditions are launch velocities slightly above the escape velocity from the trailing lunar hemisphere.", "title": ["Lunar ejecta origin of near-Earth asteroid Kamo'oalewa is compatible with rare orbital pathways"], "year": "2023"}
{"abstract": "An uncertainty analysis is conducted for four asteroids with different optical and radar observation histories in order to ascertain the degree to which near-earth asteroid ephemerides can be improved by means of radar observations. For any given set of optical and radar observations and their associated errors, the angular and earth-asteroid distance uncertainties are calculated as functions of time through 2001. The radar data furnished only a small absolute improvement in such cases as that of 1627 Ivar, where a long history of optical astrometric data exists, but dramatic reductions in ephemeris uncertainties are obtainable for asteroids having only short optical data histories.", "title": ["Radar Astrometry of Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "1987"}
{"abstract": "We present here VRI spectrophotometry of 39 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) observed with the Sutherland, South Africa, node of the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet). Of the 39 NEAs, 19 were targeted, but because of KMTNet\u2019s large 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 field of view, 20 serendipitous NEAs were also captured in the observing fields. Targeted observations were performed within 44 days (median: 16 days, min: 4 days) of each NEA\u2019s discovery date. Our broadband spectrophotometry is reliable enough to distinguish among four asteroid taxonomies and we were able to confidently categorize 31 of the 39 observed targets as either an S-, C-, X-, or D-type asteroid by means of a Machine Learning algorithm approach. Our data suggest that the ratio between \u201cstony\u201d S-type NEAs and \u201cnot-stony\u201d (C+X+D)-type NEAs, with H magnitudes between 15 and 25, is roughly 1:1.

{"abstract": "The near-Earth object (NEO) population, which mainly consists of fragments from collisions between asteroids in the main asteroid belt, is thought to include contributions from short-period comets as well. One of the most promising NEO candidates for a cometary origin is near-Earth asteroid (3552) Don Quixote, which has never been reported to show activity. Here we present the discovery of cometary activity in Don Quixote based on thermal-infrared observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope in its 3.6 and 4.5 \u03bcm bands. Our observations clearly show the presence of a coma and a tail in the 4.5 \u03bcm but not in the 3.6 \u03bcm band, which is consistent with molecular band emission from CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Thermal modeling of the combined photometric data on Don Quixote reveals a diameter of 18.4_{-0.4}^{+0.3} km and an albedo of 0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}, which confirms Don Quixote to be the third-largest known NEO. We derive an upper limit on the dust production rate of 1.9 kg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and derive a CO<SUB>2</SUB> gas production rate of (1.1 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10<SUP>26</SUP> molecules s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectroscopic observations indicate the presence of fine-grained silicates, perhaps pyroxene rich, on the surface of Don Quixote. Our discovery suggests that CO<SUB>2</SUB> can be present in near-Earth space over a long time. The presence of CO<SUB>2</SUB> might also explain that Don Quixote's cometary nature remained hidden for nearly three decades.", "title": ["The Discovery of Cometary Activity in Near-Earth Asteroid (3552) Don Quixote"], "year": "2014"}

{"abstract": "We report radar, photometric, and visible-wavelength spectrophotometry observations of NEA 2018 EB obtained in 2018. The radar campaign started at Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) on April 7, and it was followed by more extensive observations from October 5 to 9 by both Arecibo (2380 MHz, 12.6 cm) and Goldstone. 2018 EB was observed optically on April 5, 8, and 9 and again on October 18. Spectrophotometry was obtained on October 19 with the SOAR telescope, and the data suggest that 2018 EB is an Xk-class object. The echo power spectra and delay-Doppler radar images revealed that 2018 EB is a binary system. Radar images constrained the satellite's diameter to km, but the data were not sufficient for shape modeling. Shape modeling of lightcurves and radar data yielded an oblate primary with an effective diameter D = 0.30 \u00b1 0.04 km and a sidereal rotation period of hr. Measurements of delay-Doppler separations between the centers of mass of the primary and the satellite, along with the timing of a radar eclipse observed on October 9, resulted in an orbit fit for the satellite with a semimajor axis of km, an eccentricity of 0.15 \u00b1 0.04, a period of hr, and an orbit pole constrained to the ecliptic longitudes and latitudes of and . The system mass was estimated to be kg, which yielded a bulk density of g cm<SUP>\u20113</SUP>.

{"abstract": "MarcoPolo-R is a sample return mission to a primitive Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) proposed in collaboration with NASA. It will rendezvous with a primitive NEA, scientifically characterize it at multiple scales, and return a unique sample to Earth unaltered by the atmospheric entry process or terrestrial weathering. MarcoPolo-R will return bulk samples (up to 2 kg) from an organic-rich binary asteroid to Earth for laboratory analyses, allowing us to: explore the origin of planetary materials and initial stages of habitable planet formation; identify and characterize the organics and volatiles in a primitive asteroid; understand the unique geomorphology, dynamics and evolution of a binary NEA. This project is based on the previous Marco Polo mission study, which was selected for the Assessment Phase of the first round of Cosmic Vision. Its scientific rationale was highly ranked by ESA committees and it was not selected only because the estimated cost was higher than the allotted amount for an M class mission. The cost of MarcoPolo-R will be reduced to within the ESA medium mission budget by collaboration with APL (John Hopkins University) and JPL in the NASA program for coordination with ESA's Cosmic Vision Call. The baseline target is a binary asteroid (175706) 1996 FG3, which offers a very efficient operational and technical mission profile. A binary target also provides enhanced science return. The choice of this target will allow new investigations to be performed more easily than at a single object, and also enables investigations of the fascinating geology and geophysics of asteroids that are impossible at a single object. Several launch windows have been identified in the time-span 2020-2024. A number of other possible primitive single targets of high scientific interest have been identified covering a wide range of possible launch dates. The baseline mission scenario of MarcoPolo-R to 1996 FG3 is as follows: a single primary spacecraft provided by ESA, carrying the Earth Re-entry Capsule, sample acquisition and transfer system provided by NASA, will be launched by a Soyuz-Fregat rocket from Kourou into GTO and using two space segment stages. Two similar missions with two launch windows, in 2021 and 2022 and for both sample return in 2029 (with mission duration of 7 and 8 years), have been defined. Earlier or later launches, in 2020 or 2024, also offer good opportunities. All manoeuvres are carried out by a chemical propulsion system. MarcoPolo-R takes advantage of three industrial studies completed as part of the previous Marco Polo mission (see ESA/SRE (2009)3, Marco Polo Yellow Book) and of the expertise of the consortium led by Dr. A.F. Cheng (PI of the NASA NEAR Shoemaker mission) of the JHU-APL, including JPL, NASA ARC, NASA LaRC, and MIT.", "title": ["MarcoPolo-R near earth asteroid sample return mission"], "year": "2012"}

{"abstract": "We have carried out simulations to predict the performance of a new space-based telescopic survey operating at thermal infrared wavelengths that seeks to discover and characterize a large fraction of the potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population. Two potential architectures for the survey were considered: one located at the Earth-Sun L1 Lagrange point, and one in a Venus-trailing orbit. A sample cadence was formulated and tested, allowing for the self-follow-up necessary for objects discovered in the daytime sky on Earth. Synthetic populations of NEAs with sizes as small as 140 m in effective spherical diameter were simulated using recent determinations of their physical and orbital properties. Estimates of the instrumental sensitivity, integration times, and slew speeds were included for both architectures assuming the properties of newly developed large-format 10 \u03bcm HgCdTe detector arrays capable of operating at \u223c35 K. Our simulation included the creation of a preliminary version of a moving object processing pipeline suitable for operating on the trial cadence. We tested this pipeline on a simulated sky populated with astrophysical sources such as stars and galaxies extrapolated from Spitzer Space Telescope and Wide-field Infrared Explorer data, the catalog of known minor planets (including Main Belt asteroids, comets, Jovian Trojans, planets, etc.), and the synthetic NEA model. Trial orbits were computed for simulated position-time pairs extracted from the synthetic surveys to verify that the tested cadence would result in orbits suitable for recovering objects at a later time. Our results indicate that the Earth-Sun L1 and Venus-trailing surveys achieve similar levels of integral completeness for potentially hazardous asteroids larger than 140 m; placing the telescope in an interior orbit does not yield an improvement in discovery rates. This work serves as a necessary first step for the detailed planning of a next-generation NEA survey.", "title": ["Survey Simulations of a New Near-Earth Asteroid Detection System"], "year": "2015"}
{"abstract": "We present numerical simulations of near-Earth asteroid (NEA) tidal disruption resulting in bound, mutually orbiting systems. Using a rubble pile model we have constrained the relative likelihoods for possible physical and dynamical properties of the binaries created. Overall 110,500 simulations were run, with each body consisting of \u223c1000 particles. The encounter parameters of close approach distance and velocity were varied, as were the bodies' spin, elongation and spin axis direction. The binary production rate increases for closer encounters, at lower speeds, for more elongated bodies, and for bodies with greater spin. The semimajor axes for resultant binaries are peaked between 5 to 20 primary radii, and there is an overall trend for high eccentricity, with 97% of binaries having e &gt; 0.1. The secondary-to-primary size ratios of the simulated binaries are peaked between 0.1 and 0.2, similar to trends among observed asteroid binaries. The spin rates of the primary bodies are narrowly distributed between 3.5- and 6-h periods, whereas the secondaries' periods are more evenly distributed and can exceed 15-h periods. The spin axes of the primary bodies are very closely aligned with the angular momenta of the binary orbits, whereas the secondary spin axes are nearly random. The shapes of the primaries show a large distribution of axis ratios, where those with low elongation (ratio of long and short axis) are both oblate and prolate, and nearly all with large elongation are prolate. This work presents results that suggest tidal disruption of gravitational aggregates can make binaries physically similar to those currently observed in the NEA population. As well, tidal disruption may create an equal number of binaries with qualities different from those observed, mostly binaries with large separation and with elongated primaries.", "title": ["Binary near-Earth asteroid formation: Rubble pile model of tidal disruptions"], "year": "2006"}
{"abstract": "In this study, we carried out photometric, spectroscopic, and for the first time, polarimetric observations of the Amor-type near-Earth asteroid (2059) Baboquivari. Our findings represent the first reliable determination of Baboquivari's physical properties. We used data from a 1m-class telescope (T100) along with ALCDEF data for photometric analyses and a 1.5-m-class telescope (RTT150) for polarimetric, spectroscopic, and additional photometric observations. We obtained the synodic rotation period of Baboquivari as 129.93 \u00b1 2.31 h and the standard phase function parameters H and G as 16.05 \u00b1 0.05, 0.22 \u00b1 0.02, respectively. Our colour index (V-R) measurement of 0.45 \u00b1 0.02 is consistent with spectroscopic observations, indicating an S (or sub-S) spectral type. Using the polarimetric and spectroscopic data, we found that the geometric albedo is 0.15 \u00b1 0.03, and the spectral type is Sq. Based on the estimated albedo and absolute magnitude, Baboquivari has an effective diameter of 2.12 \u00b1 0.21 km.

{"abstract": "Asteroid 3753 (1986 TO) is in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with Earth, on a complex horseshoe-type orbit. Numerical experiments are performed to determine its medium-term stability and the means by which it may have entered its current orbit. Though 3753 moves primarily under the influence of the Sun and Earth, the giant planets (and Jupiter especially) play an important role by influencing, through torque-induced precession, the position of the asteroid's nodes. Variations in the nodal distance strongly affect the interaction of 3753 with Earth and may change or destroy the horseshoe-like behavior currently seen. This precession of the nodes provides a mechanism for placing minor planets into, or removing them from, a variety of horseshoe-type orbits. The chaotic nature of this asteroid's orbit makes predictions difficult on timescales longer than its Lyapunov time (~150 yr); therefore, ensembles of particles on orbits near that of 3753 are considered. The asteroid has a high probability of passing close to Venus and/or Mars on 10^4 yr timescales, pointing to a dynamical age much shorter than that of the solar system.", "title": ["The Orbital Evolution of Near-Earth Asteroid 3753"], "year": "1998"}
