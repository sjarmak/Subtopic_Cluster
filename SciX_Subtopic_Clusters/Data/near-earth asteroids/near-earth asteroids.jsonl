{"abstract": "It has become common practice in studies of the thermal emission from near-Earth asteroids to employ thermal models developed on the basis of infrared observations of large, main-belt asteroids. However, near-Earth asteroids are relatively small and are expected to have less dusty, \"rockier,\" surfaces with higher thermal inertias than main-belt asteroids. Furthermore, they tend to have irregular shapes and are often observed at large solar phase angles, compared to main-belt objects. Therefore, the applicability of the commonly used asteroid thermal models to these objects is not self-evident. Radiometric data in the 4-20-\u03bcm range of several near-Earth asteroids are compared with model predictions of the thermal emission. For all the objects considered both the \"standard\" and \"fast rotating\" thermal models produce poor fits to the observational data. Simple modifications to the standard thermal model are described that lead to significantly improved fits to the data. Revised estimates of the albedos and sizes of a number of near-Earth asteroids are derived using the resulting new thermal model with an empirically derived calibration parameter and compared with existing data from other sources. The new model is proposed as a default simple thermal model for estimating albedos and diameters of near-Earth asteroids.", "title": ["A Thermal Model for Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "1998"}
{"abstract": "Photometric data on 17 binary near-Earth asteroids (15 of them are certain detections, two are probables) were analysed and characteristic properties of the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) binary population were inferred. We have found that binary systems with a secondary-to-primary mean diameter ratio D/D\u2a7e0.18 concentrate among NEAs smaller than 2 km in diameter; the abundance of such binaries decreases significantly among larger NEAs. Secondaries show an upper size limit of D=0.5-1 km. Systems with D/D\u2a7d0.5 are abundant but larger satellites are significantly less common. Primaries have spheroidal shapes and they rotate rapidly, with periods concentrating between 2.2 to 2.8 h and with a tail of the distribution up to \u223c4 h. The fast rotators are close to the critical spin for rubble piles with bulk densities about 2 g/cm <SUP>3</SUP>. Orbital periods show an apparent cut-off at P\u223c11 h; closer systems with shorter orbital periods have not been discovered, which is consistent with the Roche limit for strengthless bodies. Secondaries are more elongated on average than primaries. Most, but not all, of their rotations appear to be synchronized with the orbital motion; nonsynchronous secondary rotations may occur especially among wider systems with P&gt;20 h. The specific total angular momentum of most of the binary systems is similar to within \u00b120% and close to the angular momentum of a sphere with the same total mass and density, rotating at the disruption limit; this suggests that the binaries were created by mechanism(s) related to rotation near the critical limit and that they neither gained nor lost significant amounts of angular momentum during or since formation. A comparison with six small asynchronous binaries detected in the main belt of asteroids suggests that the population extends beyond the region of terrestrial planets, but with characteristics shifted to larger sizes and longer periods. The estimated mean proportion of binaries with D/D\u2a7e0.18 among NEAs larger than 0.3 km is 15\u00b14%.

{"abstract": "We describe a methodology of estimating the size-frequency distribution (SFD) of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). We estimate the completion versus size of present surveys based on the re-detection ratio, that is, the fraction of all detections over a recent period that are re-detections of already discovered objects rather than new discoveries. The re-detection ratio is a robust measure of completion, but must be corrected for the obvious bias caused by differences in ease of discovery due to specific orbital geometries. We do this with a computer survey simulation using a large set of synthetic orbital elements matching as best possible the distribution of the real NEA population. Once suitably \"calibrated\" to match re-detections of the real survey, the completion estimate versus size derived from the simulation can be extended both to large size where few if any new detections are recorded, and to small sizes beyond where re-detection numbers are statistically significant, thereby providing an estimate of the population and survey completion over the entire range from the largest NEAs down to the smallest sizes detected (\u223c3 m diameter). Here we update our previous population estimates and survey progress, using discoveries by surveys from August, 2012 through July, 2014. We estimate that there are 990 \u00b1 20 NEAs larger than 1 km in diameter (absolute magnitude H \u2a7d 17.75), of which about 90% have been discovered as of August, 2014. We confirm a \"dip\" in the SFD, in the range from a few tens to a few hundreds of meters diameter, which may be due to the transition from larger \"rubble pile\" bodies to smaller \"monolithic\" bodies. We compare our population estimate at the smallest sizes with recent ones based on bolide frequency and find excellent agreement, within estimated errors. The same survey simulation methodology can be used to investigate population and survey completion of various subset populations, for example Earth-Crossing Asteroids (ECAs, with orbits crossing 1 AU heliocentric distance), Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs, with orbits passing within 0.05 AU of the Earth's orbit), or Interior to Earth Asteroids (IEOs, with orbits entirely interior to the Earth's orbit). Lastly, we have investigated the population and completion of so-called \"ARM-target\" asteroids, of size \u223c10 m diameter in orbits passing within 0.03 AU of the Earth's orbit with very low Earth-encounter velocity, &lt;2.5 km/s.

{"abstract": "Near-earth asteroids occur in three principle types of orbits: Amor, Apollo, and Aten. Amor asteroids make relatively close (within 0.3 AU) approaches to the earth's orbit, but do not actually overlap it. Apollo asteroids spend most of their time outside the earth's orbital path, but at some point of close approach to the sun, they cross the orbit of the earth. Aten asteroids are those whose orbits remain inside the earth's path for the majority of their time, with semi-major axes less than 0.1 AU. Near-earth orbit asteroids include: stones, stony-irons, irons, carbonaceous, and super-carbonaceous. Metals within these asteroids include: iron, nickel, cobalt, the platinum group, aluminum, titanium, and others. Focus is on the extraction of ferrous and platinum group metals from the stony-iron asteroids, and the iron asteroids. Extraction of the metal fraction can be accomplished through the use of tunnel-boring-machines (TBM) in the case of the stony-irons. The metals within the story-iron asteroids occur as dispersed granules, which can be separated from the stony fraction through magnetic and gaseous digestion separation techniques. The metal asteroids are processes by drilling and gaseous digestion or by gaseous digestion alone. Manufacturing of structures, housings, framing networks, pressure vessels, mirrors, and other products is accomplished through the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of metal coating on advanced composites and on the inside of contour-defining inflatables (CDI). Metal coatings on advanced composites provide: resistance to degradation in the hostile environments of space; superior optical properties; superior heat dissipation; service as wear coatings; and service as evidential coatings. Metal coatings on the inside of CDI produce metal load-bearing products. Fibers such as graphite, kevlar, glass, ceramic, metal, etc., can be incorporated in the metal coatings on the inside of CDI producing metal matrix products which exhibit high strength and resist crack propagation.", "title": ["Near-Earth asteroids: Metals occurrence, extraction, and fabrication"], "year": "1991"}

{"abstract": "The Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) program has applied electro-optical technology developed for Air Force Space Surveillance applications to the problem of discovering near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and comets. This application is natural due to the commonality between the surveillance of the sky for man-made satellites and the search for near-Earth objects (NEOs). Both require the efficient search of broad swaths of sky to detect faint, moving objects. Currently, the Air Force Ground-based Electro-Optic Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) systems, which operate as part of the worldwide U.S. space surveillance network, are being upgraded to state-of-the-art charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors. These detectors are based on recent advances made by MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the fabrication of large format, highly sensitive CCDs. In addition, state-of-the-art data processing algorithms have been developed to employ the new detectors for search operations. In order to address stressing space surveillance requirements, the Lincoln CCDs have a unique combination of features, including large format, high quantum efficiency, frame transfer, high readout rate, and low noise, not found on any commercially available CCD. Systems development for the GEODSS upgrades has been accomplished at the Lincoln Laboratory Experimental Test Site (ETS) located near Socorro, New Mexico, over the past several years. Starting in 1996, the Air Force funded a small effort to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CCD and broad area search technology when applied to the problem of finding asteroids and comets. This program evolved into the current LINEAR program, which is jointly funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and NASA. LINEAR, which started full operations in March of 1998, has discovered through September of 1999, 257 NEAs (of 797 known to date), 11 unusual objects (of 44 known), and 32 comets. Currently, LINEAR is contributing \u223c70% of the worldwide NEA discovery rate and has single-handedly increased the observations submitted to the Minor Planet Center by a factor of 10.

{"abstract": "The known near-Earth object (NEO) population consists of over 32,000 objects, with a yearly discovery rate of over 3000 NEOs per year. An essential component of the next generation of NEO surveys is an understanding of the population of known objects, including an accounting of the discovery rate per year as a function of size. Using a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) reference model developed for NASA's NEO Surveyor (NEOS) mission and a model of the major current and historical ground-based surveys, an estimate of the current NEA survey completeness as a function of size and absolute magnitude has been determined (termed the Known Object Model; KOM). This allows for understanding of the intersection of the known catalog of NEAs and the objects expected to be observed by NEOS. The current NEA population is found to be ~38% complete for objects larger than 140 m, consistent with estimates by Harris &amp; Chodas. NEOS is expected to catalog more than two-thirds of the NEAs larger than 140 m, resulting in ~76% of NEAs cataloged at the end of its 5 yr nominal survey, making significant progress toward the US Congressional mandate. The KOM estimates that ~77% of the currently cataloged objects will be detected by NEOS, with those not detected contributing ~9% to the final completeness at the end of its 5 yr mission.

{"abstract": "In this paper we update, extend, and improve upon the recent paper on Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) population by Harris and D'Abramo (2015). We update the population estimate taking into account discoveries to August 3, 2020. Shortly after the previous paper was published, we identified a problem in our previous studies due to rounding off of absolute magnitude H by the Minor Planet Center to 0.1 magnitude that implicitly shifted our bin boundaries by 0.05 magnitude. Here we correct the problem by choosing H bin boundaries at 0.25-0.75 magnitude, rather than 0.00-0.50 magnitude thereby eliminating the round-off shift. We also introduce an updated model distribution of NEA orbits (Granvik et al. 2018) in our survey simulations. This new population model includes orbital distributions as a function of size, allowing us to test our presumption that distributions are homologous with respect to size. The change in distribution of orbits between that used by Harris and D'Abramo (2015) and the newer Granvik et al. (2018) distributions was substantially greater than the range over size given in the latter, but made almost no difference in population estimates, suggesting that the re-detection algorithm is robust and does not depend strongly on the detailed orbit distribution, and also validates our presumption of homologous distribution over size. For the current analysis, we have added ATLAS and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to our analysis. We have separately analyzed the re-detection ratio versus size (H magnitude) for each of four surveys (Catalina + Mt. Lemmon, Pan-STARRS, ATLAS and ZTF) to investigate any differences between the various systems and cadences, and found none of significance, thus again, the re-detection algorithm appears very robust and mostly independent of survey parameters. With these changes and more recent discovery statistics to 2020, we estimate the number of NEAs of absolute magnitude H &lt; 17.75 (nominally D &gt; 1 km) to be 940 \u00b1 10. Following the updated population estimate, we examine more closely the rates of discovery of the largest NEAs (absolute magnitude H &lt; 17.75, nominally diameter D &gt; 1 km) to make a more detailed estimate of the numbers of these large objects that remain undiscovered. Lastly we use the distribution of albedos of NEAs from NEOWISE observations (Mainzer et al. 2011) to transform our population estimate from number versus H, N(&lt;H), to number versus D, N(&gt;D). Unfortunately this transformation depends substantially on only minor uncertainties in the albedo distribution, so N(&gt;D) remains much less certain than N(&lt;H).", "title": ["The population of near-earth asteroids revisited and updated"], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) offer insight into a size range of objects that are not easily observed in the main asteroid belt. Previous studies on the diversity of the NEA population have relied primarily on modeling and statistical analysis to determine asteroid compositions. Olivine and pyroxene, the dominant minerals in most asteroids, have characteristic absorption features in the visible and near-infrared (VISNIR) wavelengths that can be used to determine their compositions and abundances. However, formulas previously used for deriving compositions do not work very well for ordinary chondrite assemblages. Because two-thirds of NEAs have ordinary chondrite-like spectral parameters, it is essential to determine accurate mineralogies. Here we determine the band area ratios and Band I centers of 72 NEAs with visible and near-infrared spectra and use new calibrations to derive the mineralogies 47 of these NEAs with ordinary chondrite-like spectral parameters. Our results indicate that the majority of NEAs have LL-chondrite mineralogies. This is consistent with results from previous studies but continues to be in conflict with the population of recovered ordinary chondrites, of which H chondrites are the most abundant. To look for potential correlations between asteroid size, composition, and source region, we use a dynamical model to determine the most probable source region of each NEA. Model results indicate that NEAs with LL chondrite mineralogies appear to be preferentially derived from the \u03bd<SUB>6</SUB> secular resonance. This supports the hypothesis that the Flora family, which lies near the \u03bd<SUB>6</SUB> resonance, is the source of the LL chondrites. With the exception of basaltic achondrites, NEAs with non-chondrite spectral parameters are slightly less likely to be derived from the \u03bd<SUB>6</SUB> resonance than NEAs with chondrite-like mineralogies. The population of NEAs with H, L, and LL chondrite mineralogies does not appear to be influenced by size, which would suggest that ordinary chondrites are not preferentially sourced from meter-sized objects due to Yarkovsky effect.", "title": ["Mineralogies and source regions of near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2013"}

Our results are consistent with a trend of increasing albedo with decreasing size for S-type asteroids with diameters below 20 km. A number of objects are found to have unexpectedly low apparent color temperatures, which may reflect unusual thermal properties. However, the results from our limited sample suggest that high thermal-inertia, regolith-free objects may be uncommon, even amongst NEAs with diameters of less than 1 km.

{"abstract": "Thermal inertia determines the temperature distribution over the surface of an asteroid and therefore governs the magnitude the Yarkovsky effect. The latter causes gradual drifting of the orbits of km-sized asteroids and plays an important role in the delivery of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from the main belt and in the dynamical spreading of asteroid families. At present, very little is known about the thermal inertia of asteroids in the km size range. Here we show that the average thermal inertia of a sample of NEAs in the km-size range is 200\u00b140 JmsK. Furthermore, we identify a trend of increasing thermal inertia with decreasing asteroid diameter, D. This indicates that the dependence of the drift rate of the orbital semimajor axis on the size of asteroids due to the Yarkovsky effect is a more complex function than the generally adopted D dependence, and that the size distribution of objects injected by Yarkovsky-driven orbital mobility into the NEA source regions is less skewed to smaller sizes than generally assumed.

{"abstract": "We investigate the relevance of the Yarkovsky effect for the origin of kilometer and multikilometer near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). The Yarkovsky effect causes a slow migration in semimajor axis of main belt asteroids, some of which are therefore captured into powerful resonances and transported to the NEA space. With an innovative simulation scheme, we determine that in the current steady-state situation 100-160 bodies with H &lt; 18 (roughly larger than 1 km) enter the 3/1 resonance per million years and 40-60 enter the \u03bd <SUB>6</SUB> resonance. The ranges are due to uncertainties on relevant simulation parameters such as the time scales for collisional disruption and reorientation, their size dependence, and the strength of the Yarkovsky and YORP effects. These flux rates to the resonances are consistent with those independently derived by Bottke et al. (2002, Icarus 156, 399-433) with considerations based only on the NEA orbital distribution and dynamical lifetime. Our results have been obtained assuming that the main belt contains 1,300,000 asteroids with H &lt; 18 and linearly scale with this number. Assuming that the cumulative magnitude distribution of main belt asteroids is N(&lt; H) \u221d 10 <SUP>\u03b3' H</SUP> with \u03b3' = 0.25 in the 15.5 &lt; H &lt; 18 range (consistent with the results of the SDSS survey), we obtain that the bodies captured into the resonances should have a similar magnitude distribution, but with exponent coefficient \u03b3 = 0.33-0.40. The lowest value is obtained taking into account the YORP effect, while higher values correspond to a weakened YORP or to YORP-less cases. These values of \u03b3 are all compatible with the debiased magnitude distributions of the NEAs according to Rabinowitz et al. (2000, Nature 403, 165-166), Bottke et al. (2000b, Science 288, 2190-2194), and Stuart (2001, Science 294, 1691-1693). Hence the Yarkovsky and YORP effects allow us to understand why the magnitude distribution of NEAs is only moderately steeper than that of the main belt population.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) are excellent laboratories for processes that affect the surfaces of airless bodies. Most NEAs were not expected to contain OH/H<SUB loc=\"post\">2</SUB>O on their surfaces because they are primarily S-complex objects and sourced from the inner Main Belt, which is interior of the frost line, and their surface temperatures are high enough to remove these volatiles. However, a 3-\u03bcm feature typically indicative of OH/H<SUB loc=\"post\">2</SUB>O was identified on other seemingly dry bodies in the inner Solar System, such as the Moon and Vesta, and more recently on the NEAs (433) Eros, (1036) Ganymed, and (3122) Florence. The most likely sources for OH/H<SUB loc=\"post\">2</SUB>O on these bodies include carbonaceous chondrite impacts or interactions with protons implanted by solar wind. We investigated the causes of band depth and shape variations on NEAs by comparing new observations of Eros and Ganymed to those previously published and conducting a rotationally-resolved spectral study on Florence. All spectra discussed were collected by SpeX on NASA's IRTF using the LXD_short (1.67\u20134.2 \u03bcm) mode to characterize the 3-\u03bcm region.

All three asteroids possess exogenously sourced OH/H<SUB loc=\"post\">2</SUB>O and have spectra that show potential spatially correlated variations in band depth or shape. Eros' band is slightly wider at the poles than at lower sub-observer latitudes, possibly due to its high obliquity, which ensures that each polar region is oriented toward the Sun over a significant part of its orbit. Ganymed's trends in hydration band depth with sub-solar longitude and band I center suggest a carbonaceous or cometary impactor that struck the surface around 0\u00b0 relative longitude, excavating a relatively magnesium- and olivine-enriched layer. Florence's total hydrogen concentration remains stable across the surface even as the OH-to-H<SUB loc=\"post\">2</SUB>O ratio changes as the asteroid rotates.

To better understand what asteroid types a meteorite represents, it is crucial to identify the body they originated from. In this paper, we aim to determine possible parent bodies for the known meteorite falls among the known population of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). By using the similarity criterion D<SUB>N</SUB>, based on geocentric quantities, we found 20 possible NEA-meteorite pairs. By performing additional numerical simulations of the backward dynamics, we found that 12 of these pairs may be associated with a possible separation event from the progenitor NEA, while the remaining 8 pairs appear to be ambiguous or random associations. The most interesting are the Pribram and Neuschwanstein meteorites, which are dynamically associated with (482488) 2012 SW20 with a common separation age dating back to about 20-30 kyr ago, and the Motopi Pan meteorite, which has three candidate parent bodies: (454100) 2013 BO73, 2017 MC3, and 2009 FZ4. The average time of separation between our meteorite list and the progenitor body appears to be about 10 kyr, a time consistent with what is expected from the collision frequency of small NEAs. Based on our results, we suggest that about 25 per cent of meteorites do not originate in the main belt, but mainly from little collision events happening between NEAs in the inner Solar system.", "title": ["Identifying parent bodies of meteorites among near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2023"}
{"abstract": "The Yarkovsky effect is a thermal process acting upon the orbits of small celestial bodies, which can cause these orbits to slowly expand or contract with time. The effect is subtle ( $\\left\\langle {da}/{dt}\\right\\rangle \\sim {10}^{-4}$ au My<SUP>-1</SUP> for a 1 km diameter object) and is thus generally difficult to measure. We analyzed both optical and radar astrometry for 600 Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) for the purpose of detecting and quantifying the Yarkovsky effect. We present 247 NEAs with measured drift rates, which is the largest published set of Yarkovsky detections. This large sample size provides an opportunity to examine the Yarkovsky effect in a statistical manner. In particular, we describe two independent population-based tests that verify the measurement of Yarkovsky orbital drift. First, we provide observational confirmation for the Yarkovsky effect's theoretical size dependence of 1/D, where D is diameter. Second, we find that the observed ratio of negative to positive drift rates in our sample is 2.34, which, accounting for bias and sampling uncertainty, implies an actual ratio of ${2.7}_{-0.7}^{+0.3}$ . This ratio has a vanishingly small probability of occurring due to chance or statistical noise. The observed ratio of retrograde to prograde rotators is two times lower than the ratio expected from numerical predictions from NEA population studies and traditional assumptions about the sense of rotation of NEAs originating from various main belt escape routes. We also examine the efficiency with which solar energy is converted into orbital energy and find a median efficiency in our sample of 12%. We interpret this efficiency in terms of NEA spin and thermal properties.", "title": ["Yarkovsky Drift Detections for 247 Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2020"}

The study of NEOs is also important because of their potential hazard to the Earth. The investigation of small NEOs is challenging from Earth as they are observable only for a short time following their discovery and can sometimes only be reached again years or decades later. <BR /> Aims: We aim to derive the visible colors of NEOs and perform an initial taxonomic classification with a main focus on smaller objects and recent discoveries. <BR /> Methods: Photometric observations were performed using the 1.2 m telescope at the Haute-Provence observatory and the 1.0 m telescope at the Pic du Midi observatory in broadband Johnson-Cousins and Sloan photometric systems. <BR /> Results: We present new photometric observations for 55 NEOs. Our taxonomic classification shows that almost half (43%) of the objects in our sample are classified as S+Q-complex members, 19% as X-complex, 16% as C-complex, 12% as D-types, and finally 6% and 4% as A- and V-types, respectively. The distribution of the observed objects with H &gt; 19 and H \u2264 19 remains almost the same. However, the majority of the objects in our dataset with D &lt; 500 m belong to the \"silicate\" group, which is probably a result of an observational bias towards brighter and more accessible objects. \"Carbonaceous\" objects are predominant among those with a Jovian Tisserand parameter of Tj &lt; 3.

The synodic periods in the range 2.3-230 h were detected for 25 of them; 21 periods are new and in 4 cases we confirmed earlier determinations. In 20 cases the synodic periods are interpreted as being the rotation periods. Among the 5 exceptions, in two cases there remains an uncertainty whether the detected period is not half or twice that of the rotation period, and in another two cases-(3691) 1982 FT and 1997 BR-there were found large deviations of the lightcurve points from the mean curves that can be due to possible complex rotations of the small, slowly rotating asteroids. Overall, the short period end (2.3-3.3 h) of the spin rate distribution shows characteristics that are consistent with the hypothesis of their \u201crubble pile\u201d structure, as noted by Harris (LunarPlanet. Sci.XXVII, 493-494); specifically, there is a \u201cbarrier\u201d against spins faster than 2.3 h and the amplitudes of the fast rotating NEAs are smaller in comparison with the other, longer period NEAs. In the group of slow rotators (P&gt; 12 h), the suggested presence of objects in excited rotation states must be confirmed by further observations using also different techniques. This slow rotators group may be actually more abundant than our results suggest (6 of 25 objects, i.e., 20-30%), since there is a bias against low-amplitude slow rotators in the groundbased photometric program.", "title": ["Lightcurves of 26 Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "1998"}

The mineralogy and petrology of 17 near-Earth asteroids are characterized using reflectance spectroscopy with ground-based telescopes as one method to address their major issues. Implications for the origin and evolution are discussed in a separate paper. Assuming the surfaces are composed of cosmically abundant materials, the presence of certain mineralogical species can be determined from diagnostic absorption features and spectral characteristics which have been studied under known laboratory conditions and understood in terms of crystal field theory. With one possible exception, the surface composition of near-Earth asteroids consists of common rock-forming minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, and phyllosilicates. Opaque components are present but cannot be mineralogically identified with existing experimental data. The spectrum of 2201 Oljato cannot be interpreted in terms of common rock-forming minerals. This spectrum was examined for cometary features because its high orbital eccentricity suggests a possible relation to comets. No common cometary features are identified in its spectrum.

It will orbit the 20-km-diameter near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros for about 1 year, at a minimum orbit radius of about 35 km from the center of the asteroid. The NEAR is a solar-powered, three-axis stabilized spacecraft with a launch mass including propellant of 805 kg. NEAR uses X band telemetry to the NASA Deep Space Network, with the data rates at Eros up to 8.8 kbits/s using a 34-m High Efficiency (HEF) dish, and up to 26.5 kbits/s using a 70-m dish. A solid-state recorder is accommodated with a memory capacity of 1.8 Gbytes. Attitude control is to 1.7 mrad, line-of-sight pointing stability is within 50 \u03bcrad over 1 s, and post processing attitude knowledge is within 50 \u03bcrad. NEAR accommodates 56 kg of instruments and provides them with 84 W. The instruments are a multispectral imager (MSI), a near-infrared spectrograph (NIS), an X ray/gamma ray spectrometer (XRS/GRS), a magnetometer (MAG), and a laser rangefinder (NLR), while a radio science (RS) investigation uses the coherent X band transponder.

{"abstract": "Phase curves of asteroids are typically considered to depend solely on the scattering properties of airless particulate surfaces and the size of the object being studied. In this study, we demonstrate the additional dependence of phase curves on object shape, rotation pole orientation, and viewing geometry over an apparition. Variations in the phase curve of near-Earth asteroid (159402) 1999 AP10 over its apparition from 2020 July to 2021 January are verified to be due to aspect changes over the apparition. This is achieved through shape modelling of the asteroid and simulation of the phase curve over the apparition. We present simulations of asteroid phase curves over a range of geometries to understand the potential magnitude of this aspect effect, and under which circumstances it can begin to dominate in the phase curves. This dependence on aspect may introduce significant additional uncertainty in the properties derived from phase-curve data. We provide and demonstrate software code to estimate the aspect-related uncertainty in near-Earth asteroid phase curves through simulation and model fitting of a randomly generated sample of ellipsoidal asteroid models over the observed viewing geometry. We demonstrate how ignoring this effect may lead to misleading interpretations of the data and underestimation of uncertainties in further studies, such as those in the infrared that use phase curve derived parameters when fitting physical properties of an asteroid.", "title": ["The effect of aspect changes on Near-Earth Asteroid phase curves"], "year": "2022"}
{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroid 153814 (2001 WN5) was discovered on 2001 November 20 by the LONEOS survey. Based on its absolute magnitude of 18.3 (or diameter within a factor of two of 750 m) and minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) with Earth of less than 0.002 au, it was designated a potentially hazardous asteroid. This object was on the SENTRY list of possible Earth impactors until early 2002 when sufficient astrometry was collected to show previous potential impacts were no longer consistent with observations. Asteroid 153814 is of particular interest because it will make a very close flyby of Earth, within the orbit of the Moon, on 2028 June 26 at a distance of 0.65 lunar distances (250,000 km). Because this close approach occurs one year prior to the extremely close flyby of 99942 Apophis on 2029 April 13, asteroid 153814 is of interest as a possible rehearsal target for an Apophis observing campaign. Here, we will summarize the physical characterization of 153814 based on multiple apparitions of radar observations by Arecibo Observatory and infrared observations by the NEOWISE spacecraft. <P />Asteroid 153814 was observed with the Arecibo S-band (2380 MHz; 12.6 cm) planetary radar on 2010 October 29 and 30 providing Doppler-only, echo-power spectra and coarse ranging at a resolution of 600 m and again from 2019 August 21 to 25 providing additional echo-power spectra and coarse imaging at a resolution of 75 m. Four ranging measurements with precision on the order of 100 meters were reported. Additionally, NEOWISE observed 153814 at seven epochs between 2010 January 18 and 2020 January 23 with varying degrees of signal strength due to distances ranging from 0.1 to 1.8 au. We will present best estimates for the size, shape, spin state, and scattering properties of asteroid 153814. <P />In 2028, asteroid 153814 will become brighter than magnitude 22 by February 8 at ~90o solar elongation. It will remain at southern declinations, moving from -17o to -75o, through its close approach of 0.65 lunar distances. It will peak at brighter than magnitude 7, then fade as it moves to northern declinations. Such a close approach provides a very accessible target for optical lightcurve and spectroscopic observations as well as an extremely strong radar target. Although too far south during the exact moment of closest approach, 153814 will be observable by the Goldstone (DSS-14; 70 m) radar from mid-June to June 24 and then again just after close approach on June 26 into early July, allowing for high-resolution imaging as fine as meters per pixel. A similar viewing opportunity, narrowly missing the exact moment of closest approach, is available to the Green Bank Telescope, which is working on its own radar transmit capability. The far, southern declination of the close approach will be ideal for a southern hemisphere radar such as on the Canberra (DSS-43; 70 m) Deep Space Network antenna. Meanwhile, 153814 will be detectable by NEO Surveyor at multiple epochs between the beginning of its survey and the 2028 close flyby of Earth.", "title": ["Characterization of Near-Earth Asteroid 153814 (2001 WN5) and Prospects for the 2028 Close Encounter with Earth"], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "Numerical modeling has long suggested that gravitationally bound (or so-called rubble-pile) near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) can be destroyed by tidal forces during close and slow encounters with terrestrial planets. However, tidal disruptions of NEAs have never been directly observed nor have they been directly attributed to any families of NEAs. Here we show population-level evidence for the tidal disruption of NEAs during close encounters with Earth and Venus. Debiased model distributions of NEA orbits and absolute magnitudes based on observations by the Catalina Sky Survey during 2005-2012 underpredict the number of NEAs with perihelion distances coinciding with the semimajor axes of Venus and Earth. A detailed analysis of the orbital distributions of the excess NEAs shows that their characteristics agree with the prediction for tidal disruptions, and they cannot be explained by observational selection effects or orbital dynamics. Accounting for tidal disruptions in evolutionary models of the NEA population partly bridges the gap between the predicted rate of impacts by asteroids with diameters of tens of meters and observed statistics of fireballs in the same size range.", "title": ["Tidal Disruption of Near-Earth Asteroids during Close Encounters with Terrestrial Planets"], "year": "2024"}

We utilized the complete astrometric dataset from the MPC, encompassing all radar data and Gaia DR3 observations. The orbital computation was performed for a total of 446 Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs; including 93 Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)), and 54094 Inner Main Belt Asteroids (IMBAs) as well as Mars Crossing asteroids.

{"abstract": "On February 14, 2000, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft (NEAR Shoemaker) began the first orbital study of an asteroid, the near-Earth object 433 Eros. Almost a year later, on February 12, 2001, NEAR Shoemaker completed its mission by landing on the asteroid and acquiring data from its surface. NEAR Shoemaker's intensive study has found an average density of 2.67 \u00b1 0.03, almost uniform within the asteroid. Based upon solar fluorescence X-ray spectra obtained from orbit, the abundance of major rock-forming elements at Eros may be consistent with that of ordinary chondrite meteorites except for a depletion in S. Such a composition would be consistent with spatially resolved, visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectra of the surface. Gamma-ray spectra from the surface show Fe to be depleted from chondritic values, but not K. Eros is not a highly differentiated body, but some degree of partial melting or differentiation cannot be ruled out. No evidence has been found for compositional heterogeneity or an intrinsic magnetic field. The surface is covered by a regolith estimated at tens of meters thick, formed by successive impacts. Some areas have lesser surface age and were apparently more recently disturbed or covered by regolith. A small center of mass offset from the center of figure suggests regionally nonuniform regolith thickness or internal density variation. Blocks have a nonuniform distribution consistent with emplacement of ejecta from the youngest large crater. Some topographic features indicate tectonic deformations. Several regional-scale linear features have related orientations, suggesting a globally consolidated internal structure. Structural control of crater shapes hints that such internal structure is pervasive. From the bulk density, inferred composition, and evidence for global structure, Eros is interpreted to be largely intact but extensively fractured.", "title": ["Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous: Mission Summary"], "year": "2002"}
{"abstract": "We analyze the dynamical evolution of Jupiter-family (JF) comets and near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) with aphelion distances Q&gt;3.5 AU, paying special attention to the problem of mixing of both populations, such that inactive comets may be disguised as NEAs.

We also analyze the problem of decoupling JF comets from Jupiter to produce Encke-type comets. To this end we simulate the dynamical evolution of the sample of observed JF comets with the inclusion of nongravitational forces. While decoupling occurs very seldom when a purely gravitational motion is considered, the action of nongravitational forces (as strong as or greater than those acting on Encke) can produce a few Enckes. Furthermore, a few JF comets are transferred to low-eccentricity orbits entirely within the main asteroid belt ( Q&lt;4 AU and q&gt;2 AU). The population of NEAs in cometary orbits is found to be adequately replenished with NEAs of smaller Q's diffusing outward, from which we can set an upper limit of \u223c20% for the putative component of deactivated JF comets needed to maintain such a population in steady state. From this analysis, the upper limit for the average time that a JF comet in near-Earth orbit can spend as a dormant, asteroid-looking body can be estimated to be about 40% of the time spent as an active comet.

A new survey of physical properties for D &lt; 5 kilometers main-belt asteroids reveals that their spin rate and shape distributions are similar to those of NEAs, as is fully consistent with a main-belt origin for most NEAs.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon exhibits activity during its perihelion passage at 0.14 au from the Sun and is the likely parent body of the annual Geminid meteor shower. Its low albedo and featureless B-type reflectance spectrum indicate a primitive composition, but a definitive meteorite analogue is currently indeterminate. Here we analyse a mid-infrared emissivity spectrum of Phaethon and find that it most closely matches the Yamato group (CY) of carbonaceous chondrites. The CY chondrites experienced aqueous alteration and recent thermal metamorphism in which extreme temperatures caused mineral decomposition, resulting in the production of gas species. Temperatures within Phaethon during its close approach to the Sun are conducive to the thermal decomposition of carbonates, iron sulfides and phyllosilicates that release CO<SUB>2</SUB>, S<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O gas, respectively. Spectral detection of these minerals strongly implies that gas release from mineral decomposition is capable of triggering dust ejection.

{"abstract": "<BR /> Aims: In this paper we establish a compositional and dynamical connection between two B-type objects: main belt asteroid (2) Pallas and near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon. The final purpose is to help understand the origin of this very interesting object. <BR /> Methods: We first compare visible and near-infrared spectra of asteroids Phaethon and Pallas. We then compare the reflectance spectra of Phaethon with all the available visible spectra of B-type asteroids belonging to the Pallas family. One last spectral comparison is then performed to search for any correspondence between Phaethon and any B-type asteroid in the main belt. Numerical simulations are also carried out to explore the dynamical connection between the orbital neighborhoods of Pallas and Phaethon. <BR /> Results: Main differences between Phaethon and Pallas lie in the visible wavelength part of their reflectance spectra. We have also found that the nine asteroids belonging to the Pallas family have visible spectra that are different from that of Pallas and strikingly similar to that of Phaethon. Spectral comparison excludes any other B-type asteroid in the main belt as a possible parent body of Phaethon. Numerical simulations establish a dynamical pathway that connects Phaethon with Pallas and its family members. <BR /> Conclusions: The spectral similarities between Phaethon and Pallas family members, together with their established dynamical connection, supports Pallas as the most likely parent body of Phaethon and therefore, the associated Geminids meteor stream. We suggest that differences in asteroid sizes are the most likely explanation for the differences in the visible reflectance spectra between Phaethon and Pallas.", "title": ["Origin of the near-Earth asteroid Phaethon and the Geminids meteor shower"], "year": "2010"}
{"abstract": "Small asteroids intersecting Earth's orbit can deliver extraterrestrial rocks to Earth, called meteorites.

Observations of bolides provide pre-atmospheric orbits of meteorites, physical and chemical properties of small asteroids, and the flux (i.e., frequency of impacts) of bodies at Earth in the centimeter to decameter size range. In this chapter we explain the processes occurring during the penetration of cosmic bodies through the atmosphere and review the methods of bolide observations. We compile available data on the fireballs associated with 22 instrumentally observed meteorite falls.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) have struck the Earth throughout its existence. During epochs when life was gaining a foothold \u223c4 Ga, the impact rate was thousands of times what it is today. Even during the Phanerozoic, the numbers of NEAs guarantee that there were other impacts, possibly larger than the Chicxulub event, which was responsible for the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinctions. Astronomers have found over 2500 NEAs of all sizes, including well over half of the estimated 1100 NEAs &gt;1 km diameter. NEAs are mostly collisional fragments from the inner half of the asteroid belt and range in composition from porous, carbonaceous-chondrite-like to metallic. Nearly one-fifth of them have satellites or are double bodies. When the international telescopic Spaceguard Survey, which has a goal of discovering 90% of NEAs &gt;1 km diameter, is completed, perhaps as early as 2008, nearly half of the remaining impact hazard will be from land or ocean impacts by bodies 70-600 m diameter. (Comets are expected to contribute only about 1% of the total risk.) The consequences of impacts for civilization are potentially enormous, but impacts are so rare that worldwide mortality from impacts will have dropped to only about 150 per year (averaged over very long durations) after the Spaceguard goal has, presumably, ruled out near-term impacts by 90% of the most dangerous ones; that is, in the mid-range between very serious causes of death (disease, auto accidents) and minor but frightening ones (like shark attacks). Differences in perception concerning this rather newly recognized hazard dominate evaluation of its significance.

{"abstract": "The Yarkovsky effect is a subtle nongravitational phenomenon related to the anisotropic thermal emission of Solar System objects. Its importance has been recently demonstrated in relation to the transport of material from the main asteroid belt (both to explain the origin of near-Earth asteroids and some properties of meteorites) and also in relation to the aging processes of the asteroid families. However, unlike the case of the artificial satellites, the Yarkovsky effect has never been measured or detected in the motion of natural bodies in the Solar System. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting the Yarkovsky effect via precise orbit determination of near-Earth asteroids. Such a detection is feasible only with the existence of precise radar astrometry at multiple apparitions. Since the observability of the Yarkovsky perturbation accumulates quadratically with time the time span between radar observations is a critical factor. Though the current data do not clearly indicate the Yarkovsky effect in the motion of these bodies, we predict that the next apparition of several asteroids (in particular, 6489 Golevka, 1620 Geographos, and possibly 1566 Icarus) might reveal its existence. Moreover, we show that the Yarkovsky effect may play a very important role in the orbit determination of small, but still observable, bodies like 1998 KY <SUB>26</SUB>. If carefully followed, this body may serve as a superb probe of the Yarkovsky effect in its next close approach to the Earth in June 2024.", "title": ["Yarkovsky Effect on Small Near-Earth Asteroids: Mathematical Formulation and Examples"], "year": "2000"}
{"abstract": "Between 2010 and 2017, we have collected new optical and radar observations of the potentially hazardous asteroid (2102) Tantalus from the ESO NTT and Danish telescopes at the La Silla Observatory, and from the Arecibo planetary radar. The object appears to be nearly spherical, showing a low-amplitude light-curve variation and limited large-scale features in the radar images. The spin-state is difficult to constrain with the available data; including a certain light-curve subset significantly changes the spin-state estimates, and the uncertainties on period determination are significant. Constraining any change in rotation rate was not possible, despite decades of observations. The convex light curve-inversion model, with rotational pole at \u03bb = 210\u00b0 \u00b1 41\u00b0 and \u03b2 = -30\u00b0 \u00b1 35\u00b0, is more flattened than the two models reconstructed by including radar observations: with prograde (\u03bb = 36\u00b0 \u00b1 23\u00b0, \u03b2 = 30\u00b0 \u00b1 15\u00b0), and with retrograde rotation mode (\u03bb = 180\u00b0 \u00b1 24\u00b0, \u03b2 = -30 \u00b1 16\u00b0).

Radar measurements indicate possible variation in surface properties, suggesting one side might have lower radar albedo and be rougher at the centimetre-to-decimetre scale than the other. However, further observations are needed to confirm this. Thermophysical analysis indicates a surface covered in fine-grained regolith, consistent with radar albedo, and polarisation ratio measurements.

This object rotates in just about 34 s, and a large Yarkovsky effect has been determined from astrometry. By using these results, we aim to constrain the thermal inertia of the surface of this extreme object. <BR /> Methods: We used a recently developed statistical method to determine the thermal properties of near-Earth asteroids. The method is based on the comparison between the observed and the modeled Yarkovsky effect, and the thermal conductivity (inertia) is determined via a Monte Carlo approach.

{"abstract": "Fifteen orbital clusters (associations) were identified among ${\\sim }20\\, 000$ near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). All associations were found with a high statistical reliability using a single linkage cluster analysis algorithm and three orbital similarity functions. The identified groups constitute a small fraction (4.74 per cent) of the entire sample. Notwithstanding, they may be hazardous to Earth and its inhabitants. As with meteoroid streams, every year Earth comes very close to the orbits of each association. In two cases (2008TC3 and 2017FU102), the distance between the asteroid's orbit and Earth's orbit was shorter than Earth's radius. Among the members of the identified associations, we found 331 objects larger than the Chelyabinsk asteroid and all of them approach Earth's orbit at a distance smaller than 0.05 au. Two of the identified groups, (4179) Toutatis and (251430) Itokawa, support the hypothesis regarding the catastrophic origins of the asteroids Toutatis and Itokawa through violent collisions. This study does not focus on the origin of the NEA associations, but rather focuses on tracing the associations. Regardless of their origin, the identified groups pose a serious threat to Earth.

Here we report an analysis of our survey for near-Earth asteroids that uses improved detection technologies.

{"abstract": "Dynamical resonances in the asteroid belt are the gateway for the production of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). To generate the observed number of NEAs, however, requires the injection of many asteroids into those resonant regions. Collisional processes have long been claimed as a possible source, but difficulties with that idea have led to the suggestion that orbital drift arising from the Yarkovsky effect dominates the injection process. (The Yarkovsky effect is a force arising from differential heating-the `afternoon' side of an asteroid is warmer than the `morning' side.) The two models predict different rotational properties of NEAs: the usual collisional theories are consistent with a nearly isotropic distribution of rotation vectors, whereas the `Yarkovsky model' predicts an excess of retrograde rotations. Here we report that the spin vectors of NEAs show a strong and statistically significant excess of retrograde rotations, quantitatively consistent with the theoretical expectations of the Yarkovsky model.", "title": ["Retrograde spins of near-Earth asteroids from the Yarkovsky effect"], "year": "2004"}

{"abstract": "The discovery of 1991 VG on 1991 November 6 attracted an unprecedented amount of attention as it was the first near-Earth object (NEO) ever found on an Earth-like orbit. At that time, it was considered by some as the first representative of a new dynamical class of asteroids, while others argued that an artificial (terrestrial or extraterrestrial) origin was more likely. Over a quarter of a century later, this peculiar NEO has been recently recovered and the new data may help in confirming or ruling out early theories about its origin. Here, we use the latest data to perform an independent assessment of its current dynamical status and short-term orbital evolution. Extensive N-body simulations show that its orbit is chaotic on time-scales longer than a few decades. We confirm that 1991 VG was briefly captured by Earth's gravity as a minimoon during its previous fly-by in 1991-1992; although it has been a recurrent transient co-orbital of the horseshoe type in the past and it will return as such in the future, it is not a present-day co-orbital companion of the Earth.

The DART spacecraft will impact the satellite, causing changes in the binary orbit that will be measured by Earth-based observers. We observed Didymos using the planetary radars at Arecibo (2380 MHz, 12.6 cm) and Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) in November 2003. Delay-Doppler radar imaging of the binary system provided range resolutions of up to 15 m/pixel that placed hundreds of pixels on the primary. We used the radar data to estimate a 3D shape model and spin state for the primary, the secondary size and spin, the mutual orbit parameters, and the radar scattering properties of the binary system. We included lightcurves obtained by Pravec et al. (2006) in the shape model estimation. The primary is top-shaped with an equatorial bulge, a conspicuous facet along the equator, and a volume-equivalent diameter of 780 \u00b1 30 m. The extents along the three principal axes are 832 m, 838 m, and 786 m, (uncertainties are 6% along the x and y axes, and 10% along the z axis). The radar data do not provide complete rotational coverage of the secondary but show visible extents of about 75 m, implying a diameter of 150 \u00b1 30 m. The bandwidth of the secondary in the images suggests a spin period of 12.4 \u00b1 3.0 h that is consistent with rotation that is synchronized with the mutual orbit period of 11.9 h.

{"abstract": "We present an approach that significantly increases the sensitivity for finding and tracking small and fast near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). This approach relies on a combined use of a new generation of high-speed cameras which allow short, high frame-rate exposures of moving objects, effectively \"freezing\" their motion, and a computationally enhanced implementation of the \"shift-and-add\" data processing technique that helps to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detection of NEAs. The SNR of a single short exposure of a dim NEA is insufficient to detect it in one frame, but by computationally searching for an appropriate velocity vector, shifting successive frames relative to each other and then co-adding the shifted frames in post-processing, we synthetically create a long-exposure image as if the telescope were tracking the object. This approach, which we call \"synthetic tracking,\" enhances the familiar shift-and-add technique with the ability to do a wide blind search, detect, and track dim and fast-moving NEAs in near real time. We discuss also how synthetic tracking improves the astrometry of fast-moving NEAs. We apply this technique to observations of two known asteroids conducted on the Palomar 200 inch telescope and demonstrate improved SNR and 10 fold improvement of astrometric precision over the traditional long-exposure approach. In the past 5 yr, about 150 NEAs with absolute magnitudes H = 28 (~10 m in size) or fainter have been discovered.

The presence of orbiting particles in the system is likely for most of the estimated range of values for mass and volume. The spatial mass density of ejected material is calculated for different particle sizes and at different heliocentric orbit epochs, revealing that large particles dominate the mass density distribution and that small particle abundance depends on observation epoch.

{"abstract": "While computing an improved near-Earth object (NEO) steady-state orbital distribution model, we discovered in the numerical integrations the unexpected production of retrograde orbits for asteroids that had originally exited from the accepted main-belt source regions.

These rare outcomes typically happen when asteroid orbits flip to a retrograde configuration while in the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter and then live for ~0.001 to 100 Myr. The model predicts, given the estimated near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population, that a few retrograde 0.1-1 km NEAs should exist. Currently, there are two known MPC NEOs with asteroidal designations on retrograde orbits which we therefore claim could be escaped asteroids instead of devolatilized comets.

{"abstract": "Phase reddening is an effect that produces an increase of the spectral slope and variations in the strength of the absorption bands as the phase angle increases. In order to understand its effect on spectroscopic observations of asteroids, we have analyzed the visible and near-infrared spectra (0.45-2.5 \u03bcm) of 12 near-Earth asteroids observed at different phase angles. All these asteroids are classified as either S-complex or Q-type asteroids. In addition, we have acquired laboratory spectra of three different types of ordinary chondrites at phase angles ranging from 13\u00b0 to 120\u00b0. We have found that both, asteroid and meteorite spectra show an increase in band depths with increasing phase angle. In the case of the asteroids the Band I depth increases in the range of \u223c2\u00b0 &lt; g &lt; 70\u00b0 and the Band II depth increases in the range of \u223c2\u00b0 &lt; g &lt; 55\u00b0. Using this information we have derived equations that can be used to correct the effect of phase reddening in the band depths. Of the three meteorite samples, the (olivine-rich) LL6 ordinary chondrite is the most affected by phase reddening. The studied ordinary chondrites have their maximum spectral contrast of Band I depths at a phase angle of \u223c60\u00b0, followed by a decrease between 60\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 phase angle. The Band II depths of these samples have their maximum spectral contrast at phase angles of 30-60\u00b0 which then gradually decreases to 120\u00b0 phase angle. The spectral slope of the ordinary chondrites spectra shows a significant increase with increasing phase angle for g &gt; 30\u00b0. Variations in band centers and band area ratio (BAR) values were also found, however they seems to have no significant impact on the mineralogical analysis. Our study showed that the increase in spectral slope caused by phase reddening is comparable to certain degree of space weathering. In particular, an increase in phase angle in the range of 30-120\u00b0 will produce a reddening of the reflectance spectra equivalent to exposure times of \u223c0.1 \u00d7 10<SUP>6</SUP>-1.3 \u00d7 10<SUP>6</SUP> years at about 1 AU from the Sun.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroid, Kamo'oalewa (469219), is one of a small number of known quasi-satellites of Earth; it transitions between quasi-satellite and horseshoe orbital states on centennial timescales, maintaining this dynamics over megayears. The similarity of its reflectance spectrum to lunar silicates and its Earth-like orbit both suggest that it originated from the lunar surface. Here we carry out numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of particles launched from different locations on the lunar surface with a range of ejection velocities in order to assess the hypothesis that Kamo`oalewa originated as a debris-fragment from a meteoroidal impact with the lunar surface. As these ejecta escape the Earth-Moon environment, they face a dynamical barrier for entry into Earth's co-orbital space. However, a small fraction of launch conditions yields outcomes that are compatible with Kamo`oalewa's orbit. The most favored conditions are launch velocities slightly above the escape velocity from the trailing lunar hemisphere.", "title": ["Lunar ejecta origin of near-Earth asteroid Kamo'oalewa is compatible with rare orbital pathways"], "year": "2023"}

Targeted observations were performed within 44 days (median: 16 days, min: 4 days) of each NEA\u2019s discovery date. Our broadband spectrophotometry is reliable enough to distinguish among four asteroid taxonomies and we were able to confidently categorize 31 of the 39 observed targets as either an S-, C-, X-, or D-type asteroid by means of a Machine Learning algorithm approach.

One of the most promising NEO candidates for a cometary origin is near-Earth asteroid (3552) Don Quixote, which has never been reported to show activity. Here we present the discovery of cometary activity in Don Quixote based on thermal-infrared observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope in its 3.6 and 4.5 \u03bcm bands. Our observations clearly show the presence of a coma and a tail in the 4.5 \u03bcm but not in the 3.6 \u03bcm band, which is consistent with molecular band emission from CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Thermal modeling of the combined photometric data on Don Quixote reveals a diameter of 18.4_{-0.4}^{+0.3} km and an albedo of 0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}, which confirms Don Quixote to be the third-largest known NEO.

{"abstract": "MarcoPolo-R is a sample return mission to a primitive Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) proposed in collaboration with NASA. It will rendezvous with a primitive NEA, scientifically characterize it at multiple scales, and return a unique sample to Earth unaltered by the atmospheric entry process or terrestrial weathering. MarcoPolo-R will return bulk samples (up to 2 kg) from an organic-rich binary asteroid to Earth for laboratory analyses, allowing us to: explore the origin of planetary materials and initial stages of habitable planet formation; identify and characterize the organics and volatiles in a primitive asteroid; understand the unique geomorphology, dynamics and evolution of a binary NEA. This project is based on the previous Marco Polo mission study, which was selected for the Assessment Phase of the first round of Cosmic Vision. Its scientific rationale was highly ranked by ESA committees and it was not selected only because the estimated cost was higher than the allotted amount for an M class mission. The cost of MarcoPolo-R will be reduced to within the ESA medium mission budget by collaboration with APL (John Hopkins University) and JPL in the NASA program for coordination with ESA's Cosmic Vision Call. The baseline target is a binary asteroid (175706) 1996 FG3, which offers a very efficient operational and technical mission profile. A binary target also provides enhanced science return. The choice of this target will allow new investigations to be performed more easily than at a single object, and also enables investigations of the fascinating geology and geophysics of asteroids that are impossible at a single object. Several launch windows have been identified in the time-span 2020-2024. A number of other possible primitive single targets of high scientific interest have been identified covering a wide range of possible launch dates. The baseline mission scenario of MarcoPolo-R to 1996 FG3 is as follows: a single primary spacecraft provided by ESA, carrying the Earth Re-entry Capsule, sample acquisition and transfer system provided by NASA, will be launched by a Soyuz-Fregat rocket from Kourou into GTO and using two space segment stages. Two similar missions with two launch windows, in 2021 and 2022 and for both sample return in 2029 (with mission duration of 7 and 8 years), have been defined. Earlier or later launches, in 2020 or 2024, also offer good opportunities. All manoeuvres are carried out by a chemical propulsion system. MarcoPolo-R takes advantage of three industrial studies completed as part of the previous Marco Polo mission (see ESA/SRE (2009)3, Marco Polo Yellow Book) and of the expertise of the consortium led by Dr. A.F.

{"abstract": "We have carried out simulations to predict the performance of a new space-based telescopic survey operating at thermal infrared wavelengths that seeks to discover and characterize a large fraction of the potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population. Two potential architectures for the survey were considered: one located at the Earth-Sun L1 Lagrange point, and one in a Venus-trailing orbit. A sample cadence was formulated and tested, allowing for the self-follow-up necessary for objects discovered in the daytime sky on Earth. Synthetic populations of NEAs with sizes as small as 140 m in effective spherical diameter were simulated using recent determinations of their physical and orbital properties. Estimates of the instrumental sensitivity, integration times, and slew speeds were included for both architectures assuming the properties of newly developed large-format 10 \u03bcm HgCdTe detector arrays capable of operating at \u223c35 K. Our simulation included the creation of a preliminary version of a moving object processing pipeline suitable for operating on the trial cadence. We tested this pipeline on a simulated sky populated with astrophysical sources such as stars and galaxies extrapolated from Spitzer Space Telescope and Wide-field Infrared Explorer data, the catalog of known minor planets (including Main Belt asteroids, comets, Jovian Trojans, planets, etc.), and the synthetic NEA model. Trial orbits were computed for simulated position-time pairs extracted from the synthetic surveys to verify that the tested cadence would result in orbits suitable for recovering objects at a later time. Our results indicate that the Earth-Sun L1 and Venus-trailing surveys achieve similar levels of integral completeness for potentially hazardous asteroids larger than 140 m; placing the telescope in an interior orbit does not yield an improvement in discovery rates.

{"abstract": "We present numerical simulations of near-Earth asteroid (NEA) tidal disruption resulting in bound, mutually orbiting systems. Using a rubble pile model we have constrained the relative likelihoods for possible physical and dynamical properties of the binaries created. Overall 110,500 simulations were run, with each body consisting of \u223c1000 particles. The encounter parameters of close approach distance and velocity were varied, as were the bodies' spin, elongation and spin axis direction. The binary production rate increases for closer encounters, at lower speeds, for more elongated bodies, and for bodies with greater spin. The semimajor axes for resultant binaries are peaked between 5 to 20 primary radii, and there is an overall trend for high eccentricity, with 97% of binaries having e &gt; 0.1. The secondary-to-primary size ratios of the simulated binaries are peaked between 0.1 and 0.2, similar to trends among observed asteroid binaries. The spin rates of the primary bodies are narrowly distributed between 3.5- and 6-h periods, whereas the secondaries' periods are more evenly distributed and can exceed 15-h periods. The spin axes of the primary bodies are very closely aligned with the angular momenta of the binary orbits, whereas the secondary spin axes are nearly random. The shapes of the primaries show a large distribution of axis ratios, where those with low elongation (ratio of long and short axis) are both oblate and prolate, and nearly all with large elongation are prolate. This work presents results that suggest tidal disruption of gravitational aggregates can make binaries physically similar to those currently observed in the NEA population. As well, tidal disruption may create an equal number of binaries with qualities different from those observed, mostly binaries with large separation and with elongated primaries.", "title": ["Binary near-Earth asteroid formation: Rubble pile model of tidal disruptions"], "year": "2006"}

{"abstract": "Asteroid 3753 (1986 TO) is in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with Earth, on a complex horseshoe-type orbit. Numerical experiments are performed to determine its medium-term stability and the means by which it may have entered its current orbit. Though 3753 moves primarily under the influence of the Sun and Earth, the giant planets (and Jupiter especially) play an important role by influencing, through torque-induced precession, the position of the asteroid's nodes. Variations in the nodal distance strongly affect the interaction of 3753 with Earth and may change or destroy the horseshoe-like behavior currently seen. This precession of the nodes provides a mechanism for placing minor planets into, or removing them from, a variety of horseshoe-type orbits. The chaotic nature of this asteroid's orbit makes predictions difficult on timescales longer than its Lyapunov time (~150 yr); therefore, ensembles of particles on orbits near that of 3753 are considered.

{"abstract": "Processes such as the solar wind sputtering and micrometeorite impacts can modify optical properties of surfaces of airless bodies. This explains why spectra of the main belt asteroids, exposed to these 'space weathering' processes over eons, do not match the laboratory spectra of ordinary chondrite (OC) meteorites. In contrast, an important fraction of Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), defined as Q-types in the asteroid taxonomy, display spectral attributes that are a good match to OCs. Here we study the possibility that the Q-type NEAs underwent recent encounters with the terrestrial planets and that the tidal gravity (or other effects) during these encounters exposed fresh OC material on the surface (thus giving it the Q-type spectral properties). We used numerical integrations to determine the statistics of encounters of NEAs to planets. The results were used to calculate the fraction and orbital distribution of Q-type asteroids expected in the model as a function of the space weathering timescale, t<SUB>sw</SUB> (see main text for definition), and maximum distance, r<SUP>\u2217</SUP>, at which planetary encounters can reset the surface.

{"abstract": "We have studied the evolution of near-Earth asteroid (NEA) families and pairs to inform future searches. To do so, we integrated clusters of simulated NEAs with different initial conditions, namely the orbital inclination, ejection speed, and the effects of mean-motion resonances on the parent body prior to breakup while also varying the orbit, mass, and number of perturbing planetary bodies. We studied the orbital element dispersion rates of NEA family members and found a power-law increase in those families whose orbits brought them close to a planet. This allowed us to conclude that family dispersion is significantly affected by the Kozai-Lidov effect due to oscillations in the eccentricity, and that the rate of dispersion is slowest at high inclination relatively far from the nearest planet. In most cases, the ejection speed of the initial breakup does not affect the dispersion, except within weaker mean-motion resonances where more violent breakups will result in the ejection of a fraction of the asteroids, causing a large increase in dispersion. Within mean-motion resonances, where Kozai-Lidov oscillations are slowed, increases in the dispersion of a family are delayed, leading them to be identifiable for longer.", "title": ["A numerical study of near-Earth asteroid family orbital dispersion"], "year": "2024"}
{"abstract": "The apparent velocities of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are usually high when they pass by Earth. Observing these fast-moving objects with long exposure times would cause their images to streak and significantly decrease the precision of astronomical measurements. The rotating-drift-scan (RDS) charge-coupled device technique is a promising approach to observe fast-moving NEAs during their close approaches to Earth. By rotating the camera of a telescope, an NEA can be observed in the time delay integration mode. This allows the asteroid to be imaged as a point source, even with a long exposure time.

A detailed statistical analysis of the astrometric error was conducted, revealing that RDS observations can achieve a competitive accuracy with an rms error of 0.\u203324 in right ascension and 0.\u203332 in declination. The instability of the telescope is thought to be the main reason affecting the internal precision. Furthermore, the RDS technique excels at observing fast-moving NEAs, as well as newly discovered NEAs without accurate ephemerides. For NEAs with rates of motion exceeding 10 deg day<SUP>\u20111</SUP>, the rms of RDS observation residuals is 0.\u203335 in the along-track direction and 0.\u203323 in the cross-track.

{"abstract": "Evidence was recently reported for the existence of a near-Earth belt of small, Earth-approaching asteroids (SEAs) with diameters less than \u223c50 m. This result was based upon observations made with the Spacewatch Telescope of the University of Arizona during the course of an ongoing search for Earth-approaching asteroids. Using a model to describe the effects of observational bias, it was shown that the orbits observed for SEAs are inconsistent with the orbits of Earth approachers larger than \u223c1 km, and imply a relatively high fraction of Earth-like orbits among the SEAs. In this paper, new observations are included and the bias model is extended in order to quantify the number of SEAs within the near-Earth belt and to further constrain their orbital distribution. The calculation shows that relative to larger Earth approachers, SEAs are deficient in Aten-type orbits for which the semimajor axis is less than 1.0 AU. Instead, nearly all SEAs with aphelia less than 1.4 AU (5 \u00b1 3% of the total population) have perihelia between 0.9 and 1.1 AU, thus defining a near-Earth belt. Those SEAs with aphelia &gt; 1.4 AU, however, have a distribution of orbits that are indistinguishable from the orbits of larger Earth approachers. Taking the near-Earth belt into account does not significantly alter the previously determined enhancement in the number of SEAs compared to an extrapolation of the numbers of larger Earth approachers. At \u223c10 m, the enhancement factor is 40 to within a factor of 2. Also, the RMS impact velocity of SEAs with Earth (17 km/sec) is nearly the same as for larger Earth approachers (18 km/sec).", "title": ["The Size and Shape of the Near-Earth Asteroid Belt"], "year": "1994"}

Our sample reveals two important results: (i) the relatively steady fraction of Q-types with increasing semi-major axis and (ii) the existence of Q-type near-Earth asteroids with Minimum Orbit Intersection Distances (MOID) that do not have orbit solutions that cross Earth. Both of these are evidence that Earth-crossing is not the only scenario by which NEO Q-types are freshened. The high Earth-MOID asteroids represent 10% of the Q-type population and all are in Amor orbits. While surface refreshing could also be caused by Main Belt collisions or mass shedding from YORP spinup, all high Earth-MOID Q-types have the possibility of encounters with Mars indicating Mars could be responsible for a significant fraction of NEOs with fresh surfaces.", "title": ["Mars encounters cause fresh surfaces on some near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2014"}
{"abstract": "Thermal infrared spectrophotometric observations of the near-Earth asteroids 433 Eros, 1980 Tezcatlipoca, and 3671 Dionysus are presented and their implications for the physical characteristics of the objects discussed. Sizes and albedos are derived on the basis of published thermal models and comparison of the infrared data with optical observations. The results for 433 Eros are in very good agreement with radar and other earlier findings and demonstrate the accuracy achievable with one of the thermal models used. The new data, together with earlier results from the literature, suggest the surface thermal inertia of 433 Eros is no larger than three times that of the Moon. The derived effective diameter and optical albedo of 1980 Tezcatlipoca (around lightcurve maximum) are D=6.7\u00b11.0 km and p<SUB>V</SUB>=0.15\u00b10.05, and for 3671 Dionysus D=1.0\u00b10.2 km and p<SUB>V</SUB>=0.40\u00b10.15. These diameters are significantly different from previous estimates. The thermal continua of Tezcatlipoca and Dionysus are indicative of high surface thermal inertias. A near-infrared spectrum of Dionysus, coupled with the high albedo, suggests an M or E classification. Such taxonomic types are relatively rare amongst near-Earth asteroids.", "title": ["Physical Characteristics of Near-Earth Asteroids from Thermal Infrared Spectrophotometry"], "year": "1999"}
{"abstract": "We present the results of the first-ever visible spectroscopic survey fully dedicated to the small (absolute magnitude H \u2265 20) near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population. Observations have been performed at the New Technology Telescope (NTT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), during a 30-night Guaranteed Time Observations programme, in the framework of the European Commission financed NEOShield-2 project. The visible spectra of 147 objects have been obtained and taxonomically classified. They show a peculiar taxonomic distribution, with respect to larger NEAs. In particular, olivine-rich A-types and organic-rich D-types are more abundant than what could be expected by extrapolating the taxonomic distribution of larger NEAs. Such results have implications for the investigation of the first phases of solar system history, including the delivery of prebiotic material on the early Earth. Having been obtained over a large range of solar phase angles, our data allowed us to evidence peculiar phase reddening behaviours for asteroids belonging to different taxonomic types. Low-albedo asteroids display no or limited phase reddening, compared to moderate- and high-albedo objects. This result suggests a promising novel way to distinguish primitive asteroids in the X-complex. In agreement with previous laboratory experiments, olivine-rich surfaces are the most affected by phase reddening.", "title": ["A spectroscopic survey of the small near-Earth asteroid population: Peculiar taxonomic distribution and phase reddening"], "year": "2018"}
{"abstract": "Spectra of near-Earth asteroids were compared to spectra of selected asteroids, planets, and satellites to determine possible source regions. The diversity of reflectance spectra of the near-Earth asteroids implies different mineralogical compositions and hence more than one source region. The presence of near-Earth asteroid spectral signatures similar to those of certain main-belt asteroids supports models that derive some of these asteroids from the 5:2 Kirkwood gap and the Flora family by gravitational perturbations. Planetary and satellite surfaces are different in composition than the near-Earth asteroids, which is in agreement with theoretical arguments that such bodies should not be sources.

{"abstract": "Spacewatch has been successfully discovering Near Earth asteroids (NEAs) for five years based upon the difference in the ecliptic rates of motion of these asteroids compared to their distant Main Belt, Trojan and Centaur cousins. The search for NEAs is usually restricted to regions on the sky near the ecliptic and opposition in order to take advantage of their increased brightness, the good correlation between the rates of motion and orbital elements, and their increased numbers in this direction. The present study introduces an analytic determination of the best location on the sky to search for NEAs based on their rate of motion. Assuming a reasonable orbit and magnitude-frequency distribution for NEAs, Main Belt, Mars crossing, Hungaria and Trojan asteroids, it is possible to derive the probability that an object moving with a specified rate in each direction at a given ecliptic latitude and longitude with respect to opposition is a NEA. The discovery probabilities are studied as a function of ecliptic latitude and longitude with respect to opposition, absolute magnitude of the discoverable NEAs, confidence level on the NEA detection, and limiting magnitude of the detection system. The discovery probabilities are examined for each of the NEAs discovered by Spacewatch. Imposing a 90% confidence level on the requirement that a candidate is a large NEA for a detection system with a limiting magnitude of V=21, it was found that scanning at opposition offers the best opportunity for NEA discovery. Discoveries are symmetric in the east-west direction about opposition due to an interesting inter-relation in the solutions for orbital elements of objects which may appear at the specified location. Detection systems with a fainter magnitude limit may find it better to scan about 45 from opposition in order to find the larger NEAs.", "title": ["Detection of Near Earth Asteroids Based Upon Their Rates of Motion"], "year": "1996"}
{"abstract": "Arecibo delay-Doppler radar images of 1998 ST27 obtained during Oct. 7-11, 2001, reveal two objects with separations in range and Doppler frequency that change as a function of time. The primary has a visible range extent of 400 m and the delay-Doppler dispersion of a spheroid, suggesting that its diameter is about 800 m. The visible range extent of the secondary is 60 m; if we assume that it is a sphere, then its diameter about 120 m. The primary/secondary diameter ratio is close to 7 and is the largest known among the seven binary near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) detected by radar to date. 1998 ST27's absolute magnitude of 19.5 combined with the primary's apparent diameter suggest a visual albedo of only 0.05. The primary and secondary sizes and bandwidths of 9 Hz and 0.6 Hz constrain their rotation periods to be less than 3 h and 6 h, respectively. Preliminary orbit estimations suggest that the orbital period is several days, that the semimajor axis could be as large as 7 km, and that the eccentricity is at least 0.3. Among binary NEAs detected by radar that have well-constrained orbits, the orbital period of 1998 ST27 is the longest and most eccentric. The rotation period of the secondary is more than an order of magnitude more rapid than its orbital period -- the first such case among binary NEAs. The rapid spin of the secondary and the non-zero eccentricity of its orbit hint that this may be a geologically youthful system. Echoes from 1998 ST27's secondary are weak on three of the four days we observed the system, implying that other radar-detected NEAs could have unrecognized companions that were too weak to detect.", "title": ["Radar Imaging of Binary Near-Earth Asteroid 1998 ST27"], "year": "2003"}

{"abstract": "We study the dynamics of the Kozai resonance for Near-Earth-Asteroids (NEAs) having semimajor axes a&lt;2AU, using both purely numerical integrations and a semi-analytical approach. For the first time, we show that due to the interaction with the terrestrial planets, the Kozai resonance may occur even at low inclinations, with the argument of perihelion \u03c9 librating around 0deg or 180deg. As in the main asteroid belt, we also find the Kozai resonance at work at high inclinations, with \u03c9 librating around 90deg or 270deg. In both cases, the resonance provides a (temporary) protection mechanism from close planetary encounters. As a consequence, a NEA locked in the Kozai resonance is in a meta-stable state, where it can stay for a comparatively long time before a close approach with a planet drastically changes its orbit. We have also found some cases of objects locked at the same time in the Kozai resonance and in other mean motion or secular resonances.", "title": ["The Kozai resonance for near-Earth asteroids with semimajor axes smaller than 2AU."], "year": "1996"}

For asynchronous satellites, the analysis reveals large regions of phase space where the spin state of the satellite is chaotic. For synchronous satellites, we show that libration amplitudes can reach detectable values even for moderately elongated shapes. The presence of chaotic regions in the phase space has important consequences for the evolution of binary asteroids. It may substantially increase spin synchronization timescales, explain the observed fraction of asychronous binaries, delay BYORP-type evolution, and extend the lifetime of binaries.

{"abstract": "<BR /> Aims: Very small asteroids (VSAs, objects with diameters smaller than about 150 m) can be spun up by the YORP effect to rotation periods as short as tens of seconds. This effect has been observed for many of them. It is also hypothesised, that in the same process their spin axes are asymptotically drawn to the position perpendicular to the orbital plane. So far this effect has been observed only for one VSA and needs further verification. For that, spin axes of several other VSAs should be determined by observing their brightness variations at many different positions on the sky. <BR /> Methods: On 4 March 2021 at 9 UTC a 30-m in diameter near-Earth asteroid 2021 DW<SUB>1</SUB> passed the Earth at a distance of 570 000 km, reaching the maximum brightness of V = 14.6 mag.

{"abstract": "The list of detected near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is constantly growing. NEAs are likely targets for resources to support space industrialization, as they may be the least expensive source of certain needed raw materials. The limited supply of precious metals and semiconducting elements on Earth may be supplemented or even replaced by the reserves floating in the form of asteroids around the solar system. Precious metals make up a significant fraction NEAs by mass, and even one metallic asteroid of \u223c1km size and fair enrichment in platinum-group metals would contain twice the tonnage of such metals already harvested on Earth. There are \u223c1000 NEAs with a diameter of greater than 1 km. Capturing these asteroids around the Earth would expand the mining industry into an entirely new dimension. Having such resources within easy reach in Earth's orbit could provide an off-world environmentally friendly remedy for impending terrestrial shortages, especially given the need for raw materials in developing nations. In this paper, we develop and implement a conceptually simple algorithm to determine trajectory characteristics necessary to move NEAs into capture orbits around the Earth. Altered trajectories of asteroids are calculated using an ephemeris model. Only asteroids of eccentricity less than 0.1 have been studied and the model is restricted to the ecliptic plane for simplicity. We constrain the time of retrieval to be 10 years or less, based on considerations of the time to return on investment. For the heliocentric phase, constant acceleration is assumed. The acceleration required for transporting these asteroids from their undisturbed orbits to the sphere of influence of the Earth is the primary output, along with the impulse or acceleration necessary to effect capture to a bound orbit once the Earth's sphere of influence is reached. The initial guess for the constant acceleration is provided by a new estimation method, similar in spirit to Edelbaum's. Based on the numerically calculated trajectories, 23 asteroids are recommended for future consideration for capture missions, provided necessary technological developments are made.", "title": ["Capturing near-Earth asteroids around Earth"], "year": "2012"}
{"abstract": "We investigate the flux of main-belt asteroid fragments into resonant orbits converting them into near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), and the variability of this flux due to chance interasteroidal collisions. A numerical model is used, based on collisional physics consistent with the results of laboratory impact experiments. The assumed main-belt asteroid size distribution is derived from that of known asteroids extrapolated down to sizes of \u2248 40 cm, modified in such a way to yield a quasi-stationary fragment production rate over times \u2248 100 Myr. The results show that the asteroid belt can supply a few hundred km-sized NEAs per year, well enough to sustain the current population of such bodies. On the other hand, if our collisional physics is correct, the number of existing 10-km objects implies that these objects either have very long-lived orbits, or must come from a different source (i.e., comets). Our model predicts that the fragments supplied from the asteroid belt have initially a power-law size distribution somewhat steeper than the observed one, suggesting preferential removal of small objects. The component of the NEA population with dynamical lifetimes shorter than or of the order of 1 Myr can vary by a factor reaching up to a few tens, due to single large-scale collisions in the main belt; these fluctuations are enhanced for smaller bodies and faster evolutionary time scales. As a consequence, the Earth's cratering rate can also change by about an order of magnitude over the 0.1 to 1 Myr time scales. Despite these sporadic spikes, when averaged over times of 10 Myr or longer the fluctuations are unlikely to exceed a factor two.", "title": ["The Main Belt as a Source of Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "1996"}

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroid 2015 TC25 was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey in October 2015, just two days before an Earth flyby at 0.3 lunar distances. By using ground-based optical, near-infrared, and radar assets during the flyby, Reddy et al. (2016) successfully characterized 2015 TC25. They suggested that the object has a high albedo and a diameter of 2 m, which makes 2015 TC25 one of the smallest asteroids ever detected. Moreover, the orbital information available at the end of the 2015 apparition indicated that 2015 TC25 had a probability of an Earth impact of more than 1 in 10000 from 2070 to 2115. To rule out possible impacts we recovered 2015 TC25 at the end of March 2017 and continued tracking the object through the end of April, when it became too faint to be observable. The recent 2017 astrometry clearly shows the action of solar radiation pressure on the orbit of 2015 TC25 with a 7.6-sigma detection. This solar radiation pressure estimate allows us to put constraints on the density and mass of 2015 TC25 and further suggests that the object is only a couple of meters in size. In particular, the area-to-mass ratio is between 0.6 m^2/t and 0.7 m^2/t and, for a diameter of 2 m, the density is about 1.1 g/cm^3. By accounting for the contribution of non-gravitational perturbations, we analyze the future trajectory of 2015 TC25.

{"abstract": "Small bodies such as the near-Earth asteroid Bennu drift in their orbit due to thermal radiation forces (the Yarkovsky effect). Ground-based observations have indicated a nonzero probability of Bennu impacting Earth, depending on how its orbit evolves. Thus, among the goals of the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) mission to Bennu were to precisely measure the Yarkovsky effect and refine the impact hazard assessment for this body. Here we address these objectives. Using OSIRIS-REx spacecraft tracking data, we derive meter-level constraints on the distance between Earth and Bennu from January 2019 to October 2020. While these data greatly improve the knowledge of the trajectory of Bennu, they also require an unprecedented fidelity for the modeling of an asteroid's trajectory. In particular, special care is needed to take into account the contribution of 343 small-body perturbers and the uncertainty in their masses. Radiation effects such as the Poynting-Robertson drag, so far only considered for interplanetary dust dynamics, now become a consideration for modeling the trajectory of a 500-m asteroid such as Bennu. By employing a thermophysical model based on OSIRIS-REx's characterization of Bennu, we estimate a semimajor axis drift of - 284 . 6 \u00b1 0 . 2 m/yr (signal-to-noise ratio \u223c1400) at epoch 2011 January 1 caused by the Yarkovsky effect. The largest source of modeling error is solar wind drag, which may lower the magnitude of the semimajor axis drift from the Yarkovsky effect by up to 0.16 m/yr. The Yarkovsky-related semimajor axis drift varies by roughly \u00b1 1 m/yr as the orbit of Bennu evolves due to planetary perturbations from 1900 to 2135. The Yarkovsky thermophysical model proves to be extremely accurate by predicting a bulk density estimate within 0.1% of that estimated through gravity science analysis. Compared to the information available before the OSIRIS-REx mission, the knowledge of the circumstances of the scattering Earth encounter that will occur in 2135 improves by a factor of 20, thus allowing us to rule out many previously possible impact trajectories. However, there remain some impact trajectories compatible with the data. Prior to the spacecraft encounter, the overall impact probability through 2200 was 3 . 7 \u00d7 10<SUP>-4</SUP> (1 in 2700). As a result of our analysis, the cumulative impact probability through 2300 becomes 5 . 7 \u00d7 10<SUP>-4</SUP> (1 in 1750) and the most significant individual impact solution is for September 2182, with an impact probability of 3 . 7 \u00d7 10<SUP>-4</SUP> (1 in 2700). Both Bennu and (29075) 1950 DA have a Palermo scale value of - 1 . 42 and share the distinction as the currently most hazardous object in the asteroid catalog.", "title": ["Ephemeris and hazard assessment for near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu based on OSIRIS-REx data"], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "The large number of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) has greatly impacted human space activities and Earth security. However, detecting NEAs in astronomical images with complex, varying backgrounds is still extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a deep segmentation assisted asteroid tracking algorithm, termed DSAT, to construct a possible pipeline for faint NEA tracking in astronomical images. First, the single-frame object detection problem is converted to a segmentation problem, enabling robust extraction of faint potential moving objects. Then, a multiframe motion prior-based moving object tracking algorithm is proposed to find real NEAs. We further propose a distance tolerance criterion to help DSAT achieve effective tracking in practical situations when detection has partially failed. Finally, the pipeline is tested with both simulated and real astronomical images at different SNRs and in crowded fields. The results showed that our pipeline has the potential to detect and track faint NEAs in complex backgrounds.

{"title": ["Spectral characterization of near-Earth asteroids on cometary orbits"], "year": "2020", "abstract": "A fraction of near-Earth asteroids has the orbital elements similar to those of comets, but a visual aspect as any other point-like source. These are potentially dormant comets nuclei who entered in a period of inactivity. Their study can provide a new understanding of the final state in which volatile-rich objects reside and of the existing organic material or water content distribution from the early Solar System.Dynamically, cometary orbits can be filtered by their Tisserand parameter with respect to Jupiter (TJup). With few exceptions, comets have TJup &lt; 3 while asteroids displays TJup &gt; 3. Although the value of TJup can indicate whether or not the asteroid crosses the Jupiter's orbit, this is not enough to outline a cometary orbit. Tancredi (2014) had developed a method to classify asteroids on cometary orbits (ACOs), based only on orbital elements, which doesn't require any numerical time integration. Beside Tisserand criterion, this algorithm rejects all samples in mean-resonant motion, with large orbital uncertainties and with large minimum orbital intersection distances (MOID) among giant planets.We seek to make a statistical analysis of the potentially dormant (extinct) comets from near-Earth objects population (NEACOs), using the spectral observations over the visible and near-infrared wavelength interval. The aim of this work is to constraint the fraction of dormant comets orbiting in the near-Earth space. For this study, we\"ve compiled a catalog with 149 spectra of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) with TJup &lt; 3. This sample represents 10% out of all known asteroids which obey the TJup criterium (Fig. 1).Fig 1. Absolute magnitude cumulative distributions of all NEACOs from Tancredi's list of ACOs with respect to all with known taxonomy, to those with TJup &lt; 3.1 and to all known NEAs (as of January 30, 2020).The data include new observations of 26 NEAs and 123 spectra retrieved from the literature. The new measurements were obtained with the 2.5 m Issac Newton Telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope for the visible region, and with the 3.0 m NASA Infrared Facility Telescope for the NIR interval.For a simplified analysis we\"ve grouped all classes from Bus-DeMeo system into four compositional groups. The silicate-like spectra group is mainly consists of objects from Q / S complex (S-, Sr-, Sq-, Sv- types) and some end-members like O-, R- and A-types. In the carbonaceus-like spectra group we've gathered together C-, X- complexes and B-, D-, T- types. The last two groups consist of basaltic asteroids, corresponding to V-type and of relatively rare spectra (miscellaneous) like K- and L-type.Figure 2. Taxonomic distribution of NEAs with TJup &lt; 3.1The dominant group is of bodies with carbonaceus-like composition, representing 47.5% (71 / 149): 26 C-complex, 22 X-complex, 17 D-type, 6 B-type. The silicate group represents 47% (70 / 149), with an effective of 66 Q/S-complex, 3 R-type and one pure olivine A-type. We report 3 extreme cases with silicate composition: 2 R-types (466130) 2012 FZ23, (394130) 2006 HY51 and one Sr-type (465402) 2008 HW1. Their TJup of 2.3, 2.39 and 2.4 respectively are too small for this compositional group. For (466130) we obtained a NIR spectrum. Also, (394130) have a low recorded albedo (0.071), reaching 980 K to perihelion. Taxonomic distribution of entire catalogue (149 samples), presented in Figure 2, displays a strong variation of compositional ratio between silicate and comet-like objects relative to TJup.Within our sample, we could gather data only for 7 asteroids which obey the criteria of Tancredi (2014). All of them are in the Jupiter Familly Comets orbital class. Their spectra classifies them in the carboanceus-like group: 4 D-type (3552, 85490, 248590, 2001 UU92), 1 C-type (475665), 1 T-type (485652) and 1 Xc-type (506437). We conclude that these 7 bodies are dormant / extinct comets. It is important to note that no object with other taxonomy than carbonaceous chondrite, had passed this enhanced criterion, in agreement with the results of Licandro et al. 2018 (who included part of these objects).References[1] Tancredi G., 2014, Icarus, 234, 66[2] Licandro J., et al. 2018, A&amp;A, 618, A170 AcknowledgementsPart of the data utilized in this publication were obtained and made available by the MITHNEOS MIT-Hawaii Near-Earth Object Spectroscopic Survey.

{"abstract": "Impact ejecta production is a ubiquitous process that occurs on all airless bodies throughout the solar system. Unlike the Moon, which retains a large fraction of its ejecta, asteroids primarily shed their ejecta into the interplanetary dust population. These grains carry valuable information about the chemical compositions of their parent bodies that can be measured via in situ dust detection. Here, we use recent Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer/Lunar Dust Experiment measurements of the lunar dust cloud to calculate the dust ejecta distribution for any airless body near 1 au. We expect this dust distribution to be highly asymmetric, due to non-isotropic impacting fluxes. We predict that flybys near these asteroids would collect many times more dust impacts by transiting the apex side of the body compared to its anti-apex side.

{"abstract": "The visible and near-infrared spectral region has a wealth of information about the composition of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), which has been captured in several taxonomic systems in distinct ways [1,2,3]. The subtle spectral variation of the few asteroids studied by spacecraft, (e.g. Eros, Vesta and Bennu), suggests that the global mixing of regolith materials at 10- to 100-meter scales is fairly complete. The spectral consistency of asteroid families, resulting from collisional disruption of larger bodies in the main asteroid belt, also confirms this uniformity in many, if not most, cases. However, on cm-scales in meteorites we often do see dramatic changes of materials and mixing of different components. NEAs can serve as a middle ground to put further constraints on how and where this mixing takes place, and over what spatial scales it is important. <P />We have NASA IRTF SpeX observations [4] of over 100 NEAs on multiple days separated by weeks to a month at a variety of viewing geometries. We have multiple apparitions for many, as a consistency check. We will compare the 0.8-2.5 micron reflectance spectra of NEAs of a variety of taxonomic classes, to determine how the variation across the surface compares to the repeatability of multiple observations. The repeatability of these observations is 4.5% including various systematic effects [5,6]. We compare this to the consistency of a single object measured multiple times per night, and over days. We can quantify the degree to which the spectral appearance is affected by phase reddening, and by rotation phase, when the period is well known.

{"abstract": "Introduction: Knowledge of the physical and surface properties of most NEAs lags far behind the current rate of their discoveries. Still, asteroid surfaces and internal structures are very diverse, and knowledge derived from a limited number of asteroids typically could not be safely extrapolated to a large number of objects. The situation calls for an alternative approach that permits estimating asteroids' properties for a much larger number of NEAs.The Demystifying Near-Earth Asteroids (D-NEAs) is the Planetary Society STEP Grant 2021 project aiming to develop a novel method that directly characterises asteroids primarily from ground-based data. In particular, the project's objective is to develop a model to characterise surface thermal properties.Methodology: The idea is based on the Yarkovsky effect, a non-gravitational phenomenon that causes objects to undergo orbital semi-major axis drift as a function of their size, orbit, and material properties. The effect joins together the asteroid's orbital dynamics, composition, and physical properties. Our idea to derive the surface thermal properties of near-Earth objects is built around these facts.Theoretical models of the Yarkovsky effect allow predicting the semi-major axis drift, assuming a set of input parameters is available. On the other hand, astrometric observations and orbit determination procedures allow detecting the semi-major axis drift in motion of an asteroid. Therefore, at least one asteroid's property that determines the drift rate could be estimated by comparing the model's predicted (da/dt) and measured (da/dt)m magnitude of the effect, as given by Equation 1:Especially critical are the thermal conductivity uncertainties that span a range of about four orders of magnitude (Delbo et al. 2015). It is also a key to proper estimation of the thermal inertia, which could be diagnostic of surface porosity and cohesion, and, therefore, for the possible presence of the regolith layer at the surfaces.Results: The first results obtained by Fenucci et al. (2021) are encouraging but also intriguing at the same time. We found that a small super-fast rotator, near-Earth asteroid 2011 PT, should have low thermal inertia (\u0393 &lt; 100 J m-1 K-1 s-1/2) to maintain the high Yarkovsky drift detected from astrometry. Future prospect: This exciting result opens the possibility for further studies. There are, however, several essential features that are not included in the preliminary model. To fully exploit the potential of our approach, it is necessary to extend the model by including, for instance, Yarkovsky correction for eccentric orbits, heterogeneity in object's density, or variable thermal inertia along the orbit (Rozitis et al. 2018). The D-NEAs project will address these issues and develop a robust model which will apply to a much larger number of asteroids.References Delbo, M., Mueller, M., Emery, J.P., Rozitis, B., Capria, M.T.: Asteroid Thermophysical Modeling.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are a key test bed for investigations into planet formation, asteroid dynamics, and planetary defense initiatives. These studies rely on understanding NEA sizes, albedo distributions, and regolith properties. Simple thermal models are a commonly used method for determining these properties; however, they have inherent limitations owing to the simplifying assumptions they make about asteroid shapes and properties. With the recent collapse of the Arecibo Telescope and a decrease of direct size measurements, as well as future facilities such as LSST and NEO Surveyor coming online soon, these models will play an increasingly important role in our knowledge of the NEA population. Therefore, it is key to understand the limits of these models. In this work we constrain the limitations of simple thermal models by comparing model results to more complex thermophysical models, radar data, and other existing analyses. Furthermore, we present a method for placing tighter constraints on inferred NEA properties using simple thermal models. These comparisons and constraints are explored using the NEA (285263) 1998 QE2 as a case study.

{"abstract": "The potentially hazardous asteroid (185851) 2000 DP107 was the first binary near-Earth asteroid to be imaged.

The normalized total angular momentum of this system exceeds the amount required for the expected spin-up formation mechanism. An increase of angular momentum from non-gravitational forces after binary formation is a possible explanation.

Our asteroids are also ~1-51 m diameter in size and ~5-60 lunar distances away at close approach, assuming their albedo values follow the albedo distribution function of known asteroids. The use of a purely simulated data set to train our model enables the program to gain sensitivity in detecting faint and fast-moving objects while still being able to recover nearly all discoveries made by previously designed neural networks which used real detections to train neural networks. Our approach can be adopted by any observatory for detecting fast-moving asteroid streaks.", "title": ["Discovering faint and high apparent motion rate near-Earth asteroids using a deep learning program"], "year": "2022"}
{"abstract": "We have identified and quantified semimajor axis drifts in near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) by performing orbital fits to optical and radar astrometry of all numbered NEAs. We focus on a subset of 54 NEAs that exhibit some of the most reliable and strongest drift rates. Our selection criteria include a Yarkovsky sensitivity metric that quantifies the detectability of semimajor axis drift in any given data set, a signal-to-noise metric, and orbital coverage requirements. In 42 cases, the observed drifts (~10<SUP>-3</SUP> AU Myr<SUP>-1</SUP>) agree well with numerical estimates of Yarkovsky drifts. This agreement suggests that the Yarkovsky effect is the dominant non-gravitational process affecting these orbits, and allows us to derive constraints on asteroid physical properties. In 12 cases, the drifts exceed nominal Yarkovsky predictions, which could be due to inaccuracies in our knowledge of physical properties, faulty astrometry, or modeling errors. If these high rates cannot be ruled out by further observations or improvements in modeling, they would be indicative of the presence of an additional non-gravitational force, such as that resulting from a loss of mass of order a kilogram per second. We define the Yarkovsky efficiency f<SUB>Y</SUB> as the ratio of the change in orbital energy to incident solar radiation energy, and we find that typical Yarkovsky efficiencies are ~10<SUP>-5</SUP>.", "title": ["Detection of Semimajor Axis Drifts in 54 Near-Earth Asteroids: New Measurements of the Yarkovsky Effect"], "year": "2012"}
{"title": ["The Physical Properties of the Near Earth Asteroids 2005 UD and 2001 SG286"], "year": "2022", "abstract": "Research into the orbital and physical properties near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is important as these objects can reveal information about the origin and history of our planetary system.Here we present our findings regarding the physical characteristics of the near Earth asteroids (NEAs) 2005 UD and 2001 SG286. The 2005 UD is currently a possible target for the DESTINY+ space mission, along with (3200) Phaeton which seems to share similar dynamic and physical characteristics. However, compared to Phaethon, there is still limited data available regarding 2005 UD. On the other hand, 2001 SG286 is another very interesting object, feasible as target for a sample-return mission which required additional observations to firmly establish its nature and composition.In order to obtain the light-curves of these objects, we used the 2.5m Issac Newton Telescope (INT) equipped with Wide Field Camera CCD4 and the Sloan photometric filters. The visible spectrum of 2005 UD was captured using the INT with the Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (IDS) instrument. Furthermore, we used the 3.58m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) equipped with the NICS instrument and the AMICI prism disperser to capture its infrared spectrum. The spectrum of 2001 SG286 was acquired using the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias equipped with Optical System for Imaging and low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) instrument. The observations of both objects were made during their recent favorable approaches (October 2018 for 2005 UD and October 2020 for 2001 SG 286).For photometric data reduction we used the PHOTOMETRY PIPELINE by Michael Mommert and the MPO CANOPUS software with the reference stars from the GAIA and APASS catalogues, respectively. The nightly zero points were found to be consistent up to 0.1 magnitudes. MPO Canopus was finally used for the rotation period analysis, using the FALC (Fourier Analysis of Light Curves) algorithm. The light-curve plots are shown below. The \"Reduced Magnitude\" on the Y axis represents the Sloan filter magnitude values that have been corrected from sky magnitudes to unity distance by applying -5 * log(rR) to the initial measurements, where r is the Earth-asteroid distance and R is the Sun-asteroid distance. The X axis represents the rotational phase.For 2005 UD, we found that a trimodal solution with a period of 7.85 hours is the best fit with polynomial orders ranging from 3 to 8, taking into account the INT data. This solution was previously suggested by Moskovitz in his presentation at PERC Int'l Symposium on Dust &amp; Parent Bodies 2019 (IDP 2019) as a valid possibility, besides the predominant value of 5.23 hours currently found in the literature [1].As for 2001 SG286, our analysis indicates that it is a non-principal axis slow rotator (tumbler), with overlapped rotational periods of 12.3 and 18.45 hours. Although we searched for a binary solution, we could not get a compelling result. Moreover, probabilistically there is a low chance of finding a companion given that the majority of binary asteroids are fast rotators.2005 UD presents a C-type spectrum according to Bus-DeMeo classification.In this case, we used the infrared data to calculate the thermal excess according to the thermal model described by Rivkin et al [2]. By further applying the aforementioned model and taking into account the heliocentric distance of the object at the time of the observation, we determined the geometrical albedo of 2005 UD to be pV = 0.06, which is in agreement to the latest estimate of Masiero et al [3].On the other hand, the high quality spectral data obtained with GTC allowed us to firmly determine that 2001 SG286 is an S-type asteroid according to Bus-DeMeo classification, a result which is not in agreement with previous studies[4][5].References:1.

{"abstract": "The discovery of the first Near-Earth asteroid (433) Eros is attributed to G. Witt. He found Eros on a photographic plate taken on August 13, 1898, at the Urania-Sternwarte in Berlin. During the same night, A. Carlois also took a photographic plate of Eros. Charlois published a position of Eros somewhat later than Witt. Charlois has never been recognized as discoverer although he observed Eros photographically like Witt, on the same night. On the contrary, Charlois has been accused to have missed the honour of this important discovery because he did not analyze the photographic plate with Eros on the days immediately following the discovery, which were a Sunday and a holiday, respectively. After having investigated the archives of the Observatoire de Nice we conclude that the discovery story is more complex. Charlois may not have recognized Eros on his photographic plate due to a mechanical problem of the telescope which did not follow correctly the diurnal motion of stars which appeared as trails on the plate parallel to the trail of Eros. From a hitherto unnoticed reproduction of a detail of the Berlin discovery plate we deduce for the first time an astrometric position as well as other quantitative results.

{"abstract": "Impacts due to near-Earth objects (NEOs) are responsible for causing some of the great mass extinctions on Earth. While nearly all NEOs of diameter &gt; 1 km, capable of causing a global climatic disaster, have been discovered and have negligible chance of impacting in the near future, we are far from completion in our effort to detect and characterize smaller objects. In an effort to test our preparedness to respond to a potential NEO impact threat, we conducted a community-led global planetary defense exercise with support from the NASA Planetary Defense Coordination Office. The target of our exercise was 2012 TC4, the 10 m diameter asteroid that made a close pass by the Earth on 2017 October 12 at a distance of about 50,000 km. The goal of the TC4 observing campaign was to recover, track, and characterize 2012 TC4 as a hypothetical impactor in order to exercise the global planetary defense system involving observations, modeling, prediction, and communication. We made three attempts with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) on 2017 July 27, 31 and on 2017 August 5 and recovered 2012 TC4 within its ephemeris uncertainty at 2.2 arcmin from the nominal prediction. At visual magnitude V = 27, the recovery of 2012 TC4 is the faintest NEA detection thus far. If an impact during the 2017 close approach had been possible based on the 2012 astrometric data, these recovery observations would have been sufficient to confirm or rule out the impact. The first automatic detection by a survey (Pan-STARRS1) was on September 25, which is the earliest that 2012 TC4 would have been discovered in survey mode, if it had not been discovered in 2012. We characterized 2012 TC4 using photometry, spectroscopy and radar techniques. Based on photometric observations, we determined a rotation period of 12.2 min with an amplitude of 0.9 magnitudes. An additional lower amplitude period was detected, indicating that 2012 TC4 was in a state of non-principal axis rotation. The combined visible and near-infrared spectrum puts it in the taxonomic X-class. Radar images at 1.875 m resolution placed only a few range pixels on the asteroid, reveal an angular, asymmetric, and elongated shape, and establish that 2012 TC4 is less than 20 m on its long axis. We estimate a circular polarization ratio of 0.57 + -0.08 that is relatively high among NEAs observed to date by radar. We also performed a probabilistic impact risk assessment exercise for hypothetical impactors based on the 2012 TC4 observing campaign. This exercise was performed as part of ongoing efforts to advance effective impact risk models and assessment processes for planetary defense. The 2012 TC4 close approach provided a valuable opportunity to test the application of these methods using realistically evolving observational data to define the modeling inputs. To this end, risk assessments were calculated at several epochs before and during the close approach, incorporating new information about 2012 TC4 as it became available. Two size ranges were assessed-one smaller size range (H = 26.7) similar to the actual 2012 TC4, and one larger size range (H = 21.9) to produce a greater-damage scenario for risk assessment. Across the epochs, we found that only irons caused significant damage for smaller size. For the larger size case, however, hydrous stones caused the greatest damage, anhydrous stones caused the least damage, and irons caused moderate damage. We note that the extent of damage depends on composition in different size regimes and, after astrometry, size is the most important physical property to determine for an incoming object.", "title": ["Near-Earth asteroid 2012 TC4 observing campaign: Results from a global planetary defense exercise"], "year": "2019"}
{"abstract": "We report a detection of a faint near-Earth asteroid (NEA) using our synthetic tracking technique and the CHIMERA instrument on the Palomar 200 inch telescope. With an apparent magnitude of 23 (H = 29, assuming detection at 20 lunar distances), the asteroid was moving at 6.\u00b032 day<SUP>-1</SUP> and was detected at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 15 using 30 s of data taken at a 16.7 Hz frame rate. The detection was confirmed by a second observation 77 minutes later at the same S/N. Because of its high proper motion, the NEA moved 7 arcsec over the 30 s of observation. Synthetic tracking avoided image degradation due to trailing loss that affects conventional techniques relying on 30 s exposures; the trailing loss would have degraded the surface brightness of the NEA image on the CCD down to an approximate magnitude of 25 making the object undetectable. This detection was a result of our 12 hr blind search conducted on the Palomar 200 inch telescope over two nights, scanning twice over six (5.\u00b03 \u00d7 0.\u00b0046) fields. Detecting only one asteroid is consistent with Harris's estimates for the distribution of the asteroid population, which was used to predict a detection of 1.2 NEAs in the H-magnitude range 28-31 for the two nights. The experimental design, data analysis methods, and algorithms are presented. We also demonstrate milliarcsecond-level astrometry using observations of two known bright asteroids on the same system with synthetic tracking.

{"abstract": "We consider the perturbations of Near-Earth Asteroid orbits due to direct solar radiation pressure (both the absorption and the reflection components). When the body is spherical and the surface albedo homogeneous the effect is small (and only short-periodic). However, when at least one of these restrictive and unrealistic assumptions is relaxed, long-term orbital effects appear and they may potentially lead to observable displacement of the orbit. We illustrate this conclusion by computing the orbital perturbations due to radiation pressure for objects with an odd-zonal distribution of albedo and for objects with ellipsoidal shape. Especially in the first case the effects are large, due to the long-term perturbations of the semimajor axis. For high-eccentricity orbits observed over a long interval of time, the (v/c)-correction of the direct radiation pressure, known as Poynting-Robertson effect, should be also considered. As an example we demonstrate that for the asteroid 1566 Icarus, during its next close approach to the Earth, the orbit displacement due to the direct solar radiation forces might be, under reasonable assumptions, comparable to the orbit determination uncertainty, thus potentially observable.", "title": ["Direct solar radiation pressure on the orbits of small near-Earth asteroids: observable effects?"], "year": "2000"}

{"abstract": "Some observatories like the recently collapsed Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico examine nearby objects by bouncing radio light off of them. A new study has now improved how we analyze these observations to learn about near-Earth asteroids.Clues from ReflectionsTheres plenty we can learn about the universe from passive radio astronomy, in which we observe the radio signals emitted by distant sources. But when it comes to objects that lie near the Earth, we have another option: active radio astronomy.Asteroid surfaces are complex, as evidenced by this up-close image from OSIRIS-REx of the surface regolith of asteroid Bennu. [NASA]With radar astronomy, were in the drivers seat: we send a beam of radio light in the direction of our target perhaps a close planet like Venus, or a nearby asteroid and then observe the reflected light that returns to us. By measuring timing differences in the reflected signal, we can map out the shape of the object and its motion.Whats more, measurements of the polarization of the reflected light the direction the light waves are vibrating tell us about how the light was scattered from the surface and near-surface of the body. This, in turn, provides information about the outer material properties of the object. Does this material consist of fine-grained dust, or large boulders? How porous is it? How reflective?The answers to these questions help us to comprehend the nature of bodies close to the Earth. This is especially useful in the context of near-Earth asteroids, where understanding the structure and composition of these potential hazards could be critical for mitigation tactics or spacecraft visitation.Radar data for near-Earth asteroid 1999 JM8, broken down into different polarization components for three different observation dates. [Hickson et al. 2021]Separating the PiecesThe catch? Interpreting radar polarimetry isnt easy. To disentangle the combined information about a bodys surface roughness, particle shape, ice content, boulder abundance, composition, and viewing geometry, we often make inferences based on well-characterized surfaces like the Moons. But when the surfaces were studying are more complex like those of near-Earth asteroids the lunar analog may not apply.To address this, a team of scientists led by Dylan Hickson (Arecibo Observatory) recently developed an improved methodology to analyze the ground-based radar polarimetry of near-Earth asteroids. Hickson and collaborators show how we can decompose the reflected radio images of asteroids to derive specific polarimetric products, and they then use numerical simulations to improve their interpretations of these signals.The authors apply their methodology to archived radar observations of three near-Earth asteroids obtained by Arecibo, demonstrating that they can retrieve a wealth of information about the physical properties of the asteroids surfaces using this approach.An Uncertain FutureThis plot shows the number of near-Earth asteroids detected by radar each year between 1980 and 2021 (last updated 4 February 2021). Despite the collapse of Arecibo (blue), we can still expect future detections from Goldstone (red). [NASA JPL]So whats next for radar astronomy now that Arecibo has collapsed? This giants demise has left the Goldstone Solar System Radar in California as the only remaining radar astronomy facility in regular use at the moment.Fortunately, we have archives that contain past data for more than 1,100 radar-detected asteroids and comets.

{"abstract": "The recent large number of new optical measurements from various surveys allowed to significantly increase the number of asteroids with known physical properties to more than 3,000 (https://astro.troja.mff.cuni.cz/projects/damit/). In particular, these properties include rotation states, i.e., sidereal rotation period and the orientation of the spin axis, and convex 3D shape models. Those are routinely derived from disk-integrated optical photometry by the convex inversion method. Photometric datasets usually consist of (i) dense-in-time lightcurves - temporal changes of asteroids' brightness within one observing night, thus during several hours, and (ii) sparse-in-time measurements that cover a large time interval of several years, but the typical difference between two consecutive measurements ranges from days to even months. These sparse data are internally calibrated, which makes them a valuable target for the inversion of asteroids' physical properties. Only photometric datasets that sufficiently sample various observing geometries lead to the unique determination of physical properties. It turned out that main-belt asteroids often have such datasets, so the majority of successful shape solutions belong to this category of asteroids. Obtaining good photometry for near-Earth asteroids (NEA) is challenging due to their smaller apparent brightness, larger proper motion on the sky, or less convenient observing opportunities (e.g., closer to the Sun, short observing windows, long intervals between possible observations). Therefore, shape and rotation state properties have been so far derived for only a few tens of NEAs. In our work, we analyze photometric datasets that we gathered from various sources (such as Gaia DR2, ATLAS, ASAS-SN) in an attempt to at least double the number of shape solutions for NEAs. Shapes and rotation state properties of NEAs are important for understanding their origin and their collisional and dynamical evolution. We will discuss our results in this context. Moreover, we will also discuss the role of stellar occultations - an asteroid is passing in front of a bright star, which is occulted, the duration of this event is directly related to the asteroids' dimension. Various observers distributed on the ground can sample different parts of the asteroid, which can lead to an accurate size estimate, and possibly even to a shape model refinement. Within the Unistellar's eVscope network of citizen astronomers, we are targeting stellar occultations by NEAs in order to estimate their dimensions with an accuracy non-achievable by commonly used techniques such as thermal modeling. This task is quite challenging, however, we will report the first successful observations of these events by Unistellar's citizen astronomers.", "title": ["Physical Properties of Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "The Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) system operates autonomously at the Maui Space Surveillance Site on the summit of the extinct Haleakala Volcano Crater, Hawaii. The program began in 1995 December and continues with an observing run every month. Its astrometric observations result in discoveries of near-Earth objects (NEOs), both asteroids (NEAs) and comets, and other unusual minor planets. Each six-night run NEAT covers about 10% of the accessible sky, detects thousands of asteroids, and detects two to five NEAs. NEAT has also contributed more than 1500 preliminary designations of minor planets and 26,000 detections of main-belt asteroids. This paper presents a description of the NEAT system and discusses its capabilities, including sky coverage, limiting magnitude, and detection efficiency. NEAT is an effective discoverer of NEAs larger than 1 km and is a major contributor to NASA's goal of identifying all NEAs of this size. An expansion of NEAT into a network of three similar systems would be capable of discovering 90% of the 1 km and larger NEAs within the next 10-40 yr, while serving the additional role of satellite detection and tracking for the US Air Force.

The calculated olivine and pyroxene chemistry of 1990 MU (Fa<SUB>13.5\u00b11.3</SUB> and Fs<SUB>12.7\u00b11.4</SUB>) are consistent with the olivine and pyroxene chemistry ranges for H chondrites (Fa<SUB>15-21</SUB> and Fs<SUB>13-19</SUB>) (Dunn, T.L., McCoy, T.J., Sunshine, J.M., McSween, H.Y. [2010]. Icarus 208, 789-797), although the estimated Fa value is at the lower end of the H chondrite range. The olivine abundance ratio of 1990 MU (0.57 \u00b1 0.03) is slightly higher but not inconsistent with H chondrites (0.47-0.55 \u00b1 0.03). The radar circular polarization ratio (same circular polarization state or SC/opposite circular polarization state or OC) (Benner, L.A.M., Ostro, S.J., Magri, C., Nolan, M.C., Howell, E.S., Giorgini, J.D., Jurgens, R.F., Margot, J.L., Taylor, P.A., Busch, M.W., Shepard, M.K. [2008]. Icarus, 198, 294-304) of 1990 MU is 0.36 \u00b1 0.03, which is higher than the mean SC/OC ratio for S-type NEAs (0.270 \u00b1 0.079). The 1990 MU SC/OC is also higher than those of (25143) Itokawa (0.27 \u00b1 0.04), (4179) Toutatis (0.29 \u00b1 0.01) and (433) Eros (0.28 \u00b1 0.06) suggesting a rougher surface at decimeter scale (Benner, L.A.M., Ostro, S.J., Magri, C., Nolan, M.C., Howell, E.S., Giorgini, J.D., Jurgens, R.F., Margot, J.L., Taylor, P.A., Busch, M.W., Shepard, M.K. [2008]. Icarus, 198, 294-304). We constrained the diameter of 1990 MU (4.4 km) using the average albedo at 0.55 \u03bcm of H chondrites (0.21) and absolute magnitude (H) of 14.1 (Flower, J.W., Chillemi J.R. [1992]. IRAS Asteroid Data Processing: The IRAS Minor Planet Survey, Philips Laboratory Technical Report PL-TR-92-2049. Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, pp. 17-43). This diameter is higher than the 2.8 km value from Harris et al. (Harris, A.W. et al. [2011]. Astron. J. 141, 10) using an albedo of 0.52 for 1990 MU. This albedo value is unusually high for H chondrites, which have an albedo range of 0.12-0.30. We compared olivine and pyroxene chemistries of 1990 MU with main belt Asteroid (6) Hebe, probable parent body of H chondrite meteorites and IIE irons (Gaffey, M.J., Gilbert, S.L. [1998]. Meteor. Planet. Sci. 33, 1281-1295), and found that 1990 MU has more high-calcium pyroxene than Hebe. Fayalite and ferrosilite values of the two asteroids are consistent with H chondrites but do not overlap each other. The differences could be due to compositional variations observed on Hebe by Gaffey and Gilbert (Gaffey, M.J., Gilbert, S.L. [1998]. Meteor. Planet. Sci. 33, 1281-1295), although the observed rotational variation in spectral parameters does not match well with those of 1990 MU.", "title": ["Surface composition of near-Earth Asteroid (4953) 1990 MU: Possible fragment of (6) Hebe"], "year": "2014"}

{"abstract": "Missions to asteroids and comets are becoming increasingly feasible both from a technical and a financial point of view. In particular, those directed towards the Near-Earth Asteroids have proven suitable for a low-cost approach, thus attracting the major space agencies as well as private companies. The choice of a suitable target involves both scientific relevance and mission design considerations, being often a difficult task to accomplish due to the limited energy budget at disposal. The aim of this paper is to provide an approach to basic trajectory design which allows to account for both aspects of the problem, taking into account scientific and technical information. A global characterization of the Near-Earth Asteroids population carried out on the basis of their dynamics, physical properties and flight dynamics considerations, allows to identify a group of candidates which satisfy both, the scientific and engineering requirements. The feasibility of rendezvous and flyby missions towards them is then discussed and the possibility of repeated encounters with the same object is investigated, as an intermediate scenario. Within this framework, the capability of present and near future launch and propulsion systems for interplanetary missions is also addressed.", "title": ["Basic targeting strategies for rendezvous and flyby missions to the near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2001"}
{"abstract": "We study by numerical integration the secular dynamical behavior of a sample of 32 Mars-crossing and near-Earth asteroids. We divide the planet-crossing asteroid population into two groups, with semimajor axis a &gt;2 AU and &lt;2 AU. In the former region ( a&gt;2 AU), a computer-assisted analytical theory allows us to select 24 objects which are inside or close to the main secular resonances. The numerical computation of their evolution shows that the global dynamical picture is characterized by the existence of \"fast tracks\" (strong and rapid changes in the eccentricity due to resonances) and \"slow tracks\" (random walk in semimajor axis due to close approaches to the inner planets). The v<SUB>6</SUB> secular resonance appears to be a common and very effective fast-track mechanism. A solar collision is the most probable end-state of bodies on the fast-track orbits, but hyperbolic ejections following Jupiter encounters are also observed. In the inner region ( a&lt;2 AU), no analytical theory can be applied and we integrate eight orbits of NEAs which had shown secular trends in eccentricity and/or inclination in previous (shorter) integrations. Here also evolutions mainly affected by resonances and by close encounters can be distinguished, although the interplay of the two kinds of effects appears to be complex. The existence of secular resonances in this region is pointed out for the first time, but further investigations are needed to understand their locations and strengths.", "title": ["Secular resonances and the dynamics of Mars-crossing and Near-Earth asteroids."], "year": "1995"}

{"abstract": "{We have studied numerically the dynamical evolution of 1036 Ganymed, the largest near-Earth asteroid, by integrating the orbits of tens of ``clone'' particles with similar initial conditions. Typically, the orbit initially undergoes large, coupled oscillations of the eccentricity and inclination; then, Mars encounters random-walk the semimajor axis until it reaches a strong Jovian resonance; and eventually, resonant effects pump up the eccentricity until the orbit becomes Sun-grazing or hyperbolic (after encountering Jupiter). The median dynamical lifetime is of about 10 Myr. Most orbits become Earth-crossing within 10 Myr of evolution. The origin of Ganymed and a few other sizable Mars-crossing asteroids with similar orbital elements is an open problem, since the main-belt asteroid population in the neighbouring lower-eccentricity portion of the phase space is quite sparse. Although Ganymed's reflectance spectrum has some similarity to those of the ordinary chondrites, the Earth delivery efficiency from bodies with this type of orbits is low, because they are short-lived after they become Earth-crossing.}", "title": ["Dynamical evolution of 1036 Ganymed, the largest near-Earth asteroid"], "year": "1999"}

{"abstract": "We have used Minor Planet Center (MPC) data and tools to explore the discovery circumstances and properties of the currently known population of over 10,000 NEAs, and to quantify the challenges for follow-up from ground-based optical telescopes. The increasing rate of discovery has grown to \u223c1000/year as surveys have become more sensitive, by 1 mag every \u223c7.5 years. However, discoveries of large (H \u2264 22) NEAs have remained stable at \u223c365/year over the past decade, at which rate the 2005 Congressional mandate to find 90% of 140 m NEAs will not be met before 2030 (at least a decade late). Meanwhile, characterization is falling farther behind: Fewer than 10% of NEAs are well characterized in terms of size, rotation periods, and spectral composition, and at the current rates of follow-up it will take about a century to determine them even for the known population. Over 60% of NEAs have an orbital uncertainty parameter, U \u2265 4, making reacquisition more than a year following discovery difficult; for H &gt; 22 this fraction is over 90%. We argue that rapid follow-up will be essential to characterize newly discovered NEAs. Most new NEAs are found within 0.5 mag of their peak brightness and fade quickly, typically by 0.5/3.5/5 mag after 1/4/6 weeks. About 80% have synodic periods of &lt; 3 years that would bring them close to Earth several times per decade. However follow-up observations on subsequent apparitions will be difficult or impossible for the bulk of new discoveries, as these will be smaller (H &gt; 22) NEAs that tend to return 100\u00d7 fainter.

{"abstract": "We consider some aspects of the dynamic evolution of the population of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs): the change of the rate of NEA depletion with time, including the dependence of the rate on the initial parameters of the NEA orbits, the efficiency of various channels of NEA depletion, and diffusion of NEA orbits. We studied both real asteroids and a simulated population. For the study, 3024 real asteroids larger than 1 km with a perihelion distance $q &lt; 1.6$ A.U. were selected, of which 833 NEAs had $q &lt; 1.3$, i.e., we explored almost all large NEAs. For some tasks, the population of NEAs was also modeled using NEOPOP (ESA) code. The orbits were integrated for 10 Myr using the REBOUND numerical complex. The solar gravitational field and field of planets, as well as the possibility of collisions, were considered. It is shown that the total population of NEAs has the median time of depletion ${{t}_{{{NEA}}}} \u223ceq 3.5$ Myr; this rectifies the estimates of other authors. The main advantage of the present study is that, for the first time, the dependence on the initial values of the orbital parameters\u2014semi-major axis of the orbit and eccentricity was investigated. It is shown that this dependence is very strong: for the subset of asteroids with large $a$ and $e$, ${{t}_{{{NEA}}}}$ it is dozens of times lower than for the subset with small $a$ and $e$. Obtained qualitative estimates of the dependence ${{t}_{{{NEA}}}}(a,e)$ are important for the quantitative analysis regarding the various model adequacy of mechanisms of replenishing the population of NEAs. The details of the diffusion (mixing of parameters) of the asteroid orbits in the plane \"a-e\" in the process of evolution have been studied. During the integration time, 10% of the NEAs were ejected from the Solar System, 1.5% fell onto the planets (including 0.2% onto the Earth), 17% fell onto the Sun, and 12.5% left the NEAs zone.", "title": ["On the Dynamic Evolution of the Population of Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2021"}

{"title": ["Hayabusa2 Extended Mission: Rendezvous with 1998 KY26, one of the most common but unexplored near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2021", "abstract": "Asteroids smaller than a few hundred meters in diameter are generally considered to be the most common in the inner solar system evolution; however, they are usually too faint to be detected. This prevented developing a comprehensive list of them and characterizing their physical and chemical conditions. These small asteroids may be leftovers that survived from their parent bodies' impact-driven catastrophic disruptions (and re-accumulation) or escaped from other planetary bodies during multiple processes. A better understanding of how such objects formed and evolved will constrain the material transport mechanisms in the solar system. Also, smaller asteroids frequently approach the Earth because of their highest population. Some may enter the atmosphere to cause fireball events (they explode while passing through a denser atmosphere) and impact events, leading to damage to civilization. However, it would be challenging to assess and mitigate such events without knowledge of their physical and chemical conditions. The Hayabusa2 extended mission, led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), is a rendezvous mission that plans to rendezvous with asteroid 1998 KY26 in 2031 and fly by asteroid 2001 CC21 in 2026. While cruising, the spacecraft will also continue to observe the zodiacal light and exoplanets. The major science objectives of this mission are (1) constraining the origin and evolution mechanism of small asteroids and (2) establishing knowledge about planetary defense.The rendezvous target 1998 KY26 has been observed by optical observations and ground radar in detail [e.g., Ostro et al., 1999]. This is a near-Earth asteroid with a 20 m - 40 m and a spin period of 10.7 min. Also, the radar-derived shape model infers that the shape is relatively round but still has a high uncertainty. The surface color is dark, implying the potential taxonomic classes associated with a mixture of carbonaceous materials and mafic silicates (B, C, F, G, D, P) [Ostro et al., 1999]. The reported roughness at centimeter-to-decimeter scales suggests exposed bear rocks [Ostro et al., 1999].The centrifugal force is a dominant element controlling this asteroid's geophysical properties. The bulk density should be higher than 2,800 kg/m3 to keep surface materials. If the bulk density is lower than that, the surface slope should reach 180 deg in the equatorial region, and thus particles on the surface can be lofted if there is no attraction. Identifying particles in this region will constrain the roles of cohesion. On the other hand, the polar regions may still be gravity-dominant, where small particles may preferably rest on the surface there. If particle ejection is active, those not escaping from the body may orbit for some period and eventually be accumulated in these regions. The internal structure is always tensile everywhere, although the tensile stress is low, and the bulk cohesive strength necessary to sustain the body is only ~20 Pa, which is within the reported strength of rubble pile bodies [Hirabayashi et al., 2021]. If this is the case, while the monolithic condition is favored, the rubble pile structure is still plausible. Furthermore, because of its size, the orbital and rotational conditions change due to the Yarkovsky and YORP effects in a short period [Vokrouhlick\u00fd et al., 2000; Tholen, 2003; Nesvorn\u00fd and Vokrouhlick\u00fd, 2008]. Optical observations have shown that the fly-by target 2001 CC21 has a size of ~700 m and a spin period of ~5 h. While surface compositions are not well characterized, it may be L-type, which may be related to primordial compositions in the solar system, although an S-type is also possible. Lightcurve observations [Ries et al., 2005; Pravec, 2021, personal communication] imply that this asteroid is highly elongated, a ratio of the short axis to the long axis being ~0.6. If this is the case, and this asteroid has a rubble pile structure, the asteroid should have experienced unique re-accumulation processes after catastrophic disruptions. Physical processes such as violent impacts, mass wasting, space weathering have likely changed the surface conditions; the variations in morphologies, roughness, and chemical compositions constrain such physical processes.This work presents an overview of science investigations in the Hayabusa2 extended mission targeting 1998 KY26 and 2001 CC21.References:Hirabayashi et al.

{"abstract": "Context. One-opposition near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are growing in number, and they must be recovered to prevent loss and mismatch risk, and to improve their orbits, as they are likely to be too faint for detection in shallow surveys at future apparitions. <BR /> Aims: We aimed to recover more than half of the one-opposition NEAs recommended for observations by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) using the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) in soft-override mode and some fractions of available D-nights. During about 130 h in total between 2013 and 2016, we targeted 368 NEAs, among which 56 potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), observing 437 INT Wide Field Camera (WFC) fields and recovering 280 NEAs (76% of all targets). <BR /> Methods: Engaging a core team of about ten students and amateurs, we used the THELI, Astrometrica, and the Find_Orb software to identify all moving objects using the blink and track-and-stack method for the faintest targets and plotting the positional uncertainty ellipse from NEODyS. <BR /> Results: Most targets and recovered objects had apparent magnitudes centered around V ~ 22.8 mag, with some becoming as faint as V ~ 24 mag. One hundred and three objects (representing 28% of all targets) were recovered by EURONEAR alone by Aug. 2017. Orbital arcs were prolonged typically from a few weeks to a few years; our oldest recoveries reach 16 years. The O-C residuals for our 1854 NEA astrometric positions show that most measurements cluster closely around the origin. In addition to the recovered NEAs, 22 000 positions of about 3500 known minor planets and another 10 000 observations of about 1500 unknown objects (mostly main-belt objects) were promptly reported to the MPC by our team. Four new NEAs were discovered serendipitously in the analyzed fields and were promptly secured with the INT and other telescopes, while two more NEAs were lost due to extremely fast motion and lack of rapid follow-up time. They increase the counting to nine NEAs discovered by the EURONEAR in 2014 and 2015. <BR /> Conclusions: Targeted projects to recover one-opposition NEAs are efficient in override access, especially using at least two-meter class and preferably larger field telescopes located in good sites, which appear even more efficient than the existing surveys. <P />Table 2 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (<A href=\"http://130.79.128.5\">http://130.79.128.5</A>) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/609/A105\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/609/A105</A>", "title": ["280 one-opposition near-Earth asteroids recovered by the EURONEAR with the Isaac Newton Telescope"], "year": "2018"}
{"abstract": "Near-Earth Asteroid (66391) 1999 KW4 was the subject of the recently published first extensive radar imaging, shape and mutual orbit modeling, and physical and dynamical characterization of a binary asteroid. In this paper we present in detail our numerical simulation of KW4 behind that work. Our propagations of the system with some variation in estimated parameters cover the set of KW4's possible current dynamical states consistent with the body models and other information obtained directly from the observations. We also apply our implementation of this simulation capability to address some of the dynamical mechanisms by which KW4 may be moved into the more energetically excited of those possible current states, particularly solar gravity interaction. Through comparison of the results with certain features of the observation data, we conclude that the actual KW4 system is not in the most energetically relaxed configuration but must be moderately excited. The system occupies a generalized Cassini state 2 which is different from that considered in most previously published treatments of Cassini states in that it involves co-precession of the primary's spin frame and the mutual orbit rather than co-precession of a satellite's spin frame and that satellite's orbit about the primary. We present a simple analytical theory describing the system's dynamics, which should be applicable to any other binary systems, of which KW4 is representative, in which a massive, roughly oblate primary is spinning rapidly relative to the rate of its mutual orbit with an on-average synchronous, elongated secondary. We examine separately both the effect of the larger binary component's oblateness, and the effect of the smaller component's roughly triaxial ellipsoid shape. The simple analytical formulae obtained agree with full-detail numerical simulation results, and can be used for remote estimation of binary mass properties from observed system motion.", "title": ["Simulation and analysis of the dynamics of binary near-Earth Asteroid (66391) 1999 KW4"], "year": "2008"}

We discussed the issues, especially in the field of NEAs, at the conference last year [5]. We briefly discuss the determination of the rotation period using an example of observations from the first night of the campaign of 2022 AB. More will be discussed in [2]. We used a 0.7-m RBT/PST2 telescope(Arizona), 5-s exposures, and the clear filter. We observed object for 1.5 hours and we create composite lightcurve with Fourier series fit (see Figure 1). In this way, we determined the rotation period P=182 s. Figure 1: Example of composite lightcurve of 2022 AB. Colour indices The preliminary results presented here are based on most of the data obtained. The full results will be presented during the conference.To determine the colour indices, we used observations from three telescopes: 0.7-m RBT, 1-m telescope of DOAO (South Korea), and 1-m telescope of Pic du Midi Observatory (France). Telescopes from DOAO and Pic du Midi observed the asteroid with an exposure time of several seconds in the B,V,R,I (DOAO) or g',r',i',z' (Pic du Midi) filters. Due to changes in the geometry of the observations, we divided the observations into several sets. Using solar analogues, we transformed the brightness in B,V,R,I into g',r',i',z' bands, respectively. Then, knowing the rotation period, we composited the lightcurves to determine the shifts between the lightcurves in the given bands. We have prepared the composited lightcurves separately for each set. An example is shown in Figure 2. RBT observations were made in B,V,R filters and, as we mentioned, transformed them into g',r',i'. In this case, we used knowledge of the rotation period to average the brightness measurements over the period, exposure time Texp=P=182s. Adjacent measurements in different bands allowed us to determine a series of colour indices that we averaged as one set. The results for each set are shown in Table 1. Figure 2: Composite lightcurves for DOAO set 1. Top: lightcurves in i' (dots) and z' band (crosses), middle: i' and (dots) and r' (crosses) bands, bottom: r' (dots) and g' (cross) bands. Table 1: Preliminary results of colour indices for each set. Taxonomy To determine the taxonomic class of 2022 AB, we converted the average value of colour indices to the reflection coefficients Rr,Ri and Rz, normalised to the reflection values in the g band, using the formula [6]: Rf=10-0.4[(f-g)-(f\u2609-g\u2609)] Next, we compared them with spectra of different taxonomic classes, as given by [6]. In Figure 3 we present the reflective value of the asteroid compared to similar taxonomic classes. B class asteroids are rare and they are mainly associated with the outer main belt. 2022 AB as an NEA is an unlikely class B asteroid. The Cb class fits well with the data of 2022 AB and is the only one to show the common with 2022 AB characteristic of visible absorption around 0.6 micrometre. We suggest that 2022 AB is most likely a type Cb asteroid. Figure 3: Plot of reflectivities values of B,Cb,Ch asteroid classes (black dots) and 2022 AB (red dots). Data for the B,Cb, and Ch classes were taken from [6].Diameter We can determine the diameter knowing the absolute magnitude H and the albedo pV according to equation [7]:Deff=1329\u00d710-H/5\u00d7pV-0.5 At the conference, we will present the results based on the determined H from the phase curve, but for now we used the approximate H=23.6\u00b10.36 given by JPL[1]. Albedo for Cb class asteroids: pV=0.059\u00b10.027 [8], hence Deff=0.104\u00b10.029 km. Figure 4: Rotation period-diameter plot. The red dotted line is the spin barrier (2.2 h).

{"abstract": "This presentation will show results of the observing campaign for the very small, super-fast rotating NEA, 2022 AB. It is a follow-up of our previous work on another similar object, 2021 DW1 (Kwiatkowski et al. 2021). The main objective of this project is to use lightcurves observed during one apparition along the long arc in the sky to derive NEA spin axes. They are then used to compute object obliquities to test the end states of the YORP evolution, which according to some theories should be close to 0 or 180 deg.After the discovery of 2022 AB on 2 January 2022 it became known that it would be observable from many different viewing/illumination geometries while maintaining a decent magnitude V&lt;19 mag. The absolute magnitude of 2022 AB, H=23.6 (reported by the MPC) suggested that it could be a super-fast rotating asteroid (rotation period P&lt;2.1 hours), with a diameter D&lt;150~m. The small size of this object means that its rotation can be strongly influenced by YORP.We observed 2022 AB photometrically from 4 Jan to 26 Jan, from 27 locations around the world, from Australia, through South Korea, Europe, the United States, to Hawaii. The telescope sizes ranged from 0.28-m to 10.0-m. During that time we collected 89 lightcurves exposed through different filters. The analysis of such rich data sets is time consuming and, until now, we only have some partial results. The object has a synodical period of rotation of 182 seconds, and most likely belongs to the Cb taxonomic class (see a poster by Kole\u0144czuk et al. at this conference for details).At the conference, we will present full physical characterisation of 2022 AB, including its spin axis, shape, mag-phase curve, taxonomy, and size. We will discuss the obliquity of its rotation axis in the context of YORP evolution.AcknowledgementsPK acknowledges support from the National Science Centre, Poland, Grant No. 2021/41/N/ST9/04259.ReferencesT.

{"abstract": "This study focuses on the autonomous detection of small (diameter &lt; 50 m) faint (absolute magnitude &gt; 20) Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) cameras during the approach phase of interplanetary CubeSat missions. To address the challenge of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in COTS CubeSat sensors, a design tool was developed that incorporates camera parameters, asteroid parameters, approach phase geometry and an Earth-observation based SNR boosting technique, to ensure the autonomous detection of small NEAs during the approach phase. The tool generates a synthetic SNR that meets the target asteroid detection requirements (SNR \u2265 7) by stacking multiple frames of the target asteroid. The design tool defines requirements at the camera and trajectory design levels, exploring the problem design space of an asteroid rendezvous CubeSat mission. The validation of the tool was carried out using the NEA Scout asteroid and NEA Scout CubeSat mission requirements. The results demonstrate that the autonomous detection of small faint NEAs is achievable when the asteroid's positional uncertainty is within the CubeSat sensor's field of view. These findings have implications for current and future CubeSat missions to NEAs, offering insights into the feasibility of using off-the-shelf cameras for asteroid detection.", "title": ["Improved detection of a Near-Earth Asteroid from an interplanetary CubeSat mission"], "year": "2024"}
{"abstract": "We evaluated the planetary radar capabilities at Arecibo, the Goldstone 70 m DSS-14 and 34 m DSS-13 antennas, the 70 m DSS-43 antenna at Canberra, the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and the Parkes Radio Telescope in terms of their relative sensitivities and the number of known near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) detectable per year in monostatic and bistatic configurations. In the 2015 calendar year, monostatic observations with Arecibo and DSS-14 were capable of detecting 253 and 131 NEAs respectively, with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) greater than 30/track. Combined, the two observatories were capable of detecting 276 NEAs. Of these, Arecibo detected 77 and Goldstone detected 32, or 30% and 24% of the numbers that were possible. The two observatories detected an additional 18 and 7 NEAs respectively, with SNRs of less than 30/track. This indicates that a substantial number of potential targets are not being observed.

{"abstract": "A method of separating an association of orbits, a stream, from the local background using the traditional D discriminant is introduced. Applying this procedure to all 708 asteroids with perihelia less than 1.3 AU known on April 22, 1999 suggests that the orbits of Earth-approaching asteroids may be rather organized. By searching the volume around every orbit in the sample space, 14 associations are found with from 4 to 25 members that statistically stand out from the local background. A more traditional search, where orbits are gathered into strings with every orbit connected to at least one other orbit by D&lt; D<SUB>c</SUB>, reveals eight additional three-member strings. Using Poisson statistics seven pairs are identified as having exceptionally similar orbits; three of these pairs are a part of an association or string. On the other hand, comparing the results of a volume search around randomized orbits indicates that perhaps 50 to 75% of these groupings are due to chance, indicating that observational effects may severely affect the background and therefore the reality of the associations that are separated out. The lack of compositional or taxonomic information about most of the 155 asteroids, 22% of the sample, hinders interpretation of the nature of the streams. Of the three associations found in an earlier study (Drummond 1991, Icarus89, 14-25), only one remains intact as a result of the stricter statistical requirements adopted here. Three of four fireball streams (Halliday et al. 1990, Meteoritics25, 93-99), previously found to be related to the old associations, can be loosely associated with three of the new associations, but none of the four recovered meteorites with known orbits can be associated with them. Nevertheless, theoretical meteor radiants are listed, all of which are so large and diffuse, and have such slow geocentric velocities, that it is doubtful if visual meteor showers can be linked to the new streams. However, these associations, strings, and pairs of asteroids are good candidates for meteorite sources, especially where organized falls are recognized, since they generally satisfy the immediate dynamical requirements for delivery, namely, gentle geocentric velocities produced by overtaking the Earth around sunset.", "title": ["The D Discriminant and Near-Earth Asteroid Streams"], "year": "2000"}
{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) allow us to determine the properties of the smallest solar system bodies in the sub-kilometer size range. Large (&gt;few km) NEAs have albedos which span a wide range from ~0.05 to ~0.3 and are known to correlate with asteroid composition, determined by analysing the shape of their optical reflectance spectra. It is, however, still unknown how this relationship extends into the sub-kilometer population.NEOWISE has performed a thermal infrared survey that provides the largest inventory to date of well-determined sizes and albedos for NEAs, including many in the sub-km population. This provides an opportunity to test the albedo-surface composition correlation in a new size regime. If it is found to hold, then a simple optical spectrum can give a well-constrained albedo and size estimate without the need for thermal IR measurements.The sizes and composition of many more sub-km sized NEAs are needed to aid in the understanding of the formation/evolution of the inner solar system and the characterisation of potentially hazardous objects, possible mission targets and even commercial mining operations.We obtained optical spectra of sub-kilometer NEOWISE-observed NEAs using the 1.5m Tillinghast telescope and the FAST spectrograph at the Whipple Observatory on Mt Hopkins, Arizona. We performed a taxonomic classification to identify their likely composition and combined this with NEOWISE data to look for known correlations between main belt asteroid spectral types and their optical albedos. Additionally, we tested the robustness of current data reduction methods in order to increase our confidence in the spectral classifications of NEAs.", "title": ["Spectral Classification of NEOWISE Observed Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2017"}
{"abstract": "A statistical study has been carried out of the availability of favourable flight opportunities to near-Earth asteroids with orbits similar to the Earth's. Emphasis is given to rendezvous-type mission profiles employing two-burn impulsive transfers. Velocity-optimized Lambert trajectories for a sample of 27 actual objects were calculated and compiled in a database. The velocity and flight time statistics of the resulting 1200 different solutions covering a period of 11 years have been investigated and discussed. Comparison with typical flight profiles to the Moon and near planets has revealed flight opportunities to 5 objects within a decade from the present requiring less \u0394 V than favourable flight opportunities to Mars or Venus. One of the objects involved, 1999 AO10, can be rendezvoused with using a total velocity increment that is smaller than that required to establish a lunar orbiter.

{"abstract": "Asteroid pairs are genetically related asteroids that recently separated (&lt;few million years), but still reside on similar heliocentric orbits. A few hundred of these systems have been identified, primarily in the asteroid main belt. Here, we studied a newly discovered pair of near-Earth objects (NEOs): 2019 PR2 and 2019 QR6. Based on broad-band photometry, we found these asteroids to be spectrally similar to D-types, a type rare amongst NEOs. We recovered astrometric observations for both asteroids from the Catalina Sky Survey from 2005, which significantly improved their fitted orbits. With these refinements we ran backwards orbital integrations to study formation and evolutionary history. We found that neither a pure gravitational model nor a model with the Yarkovsky effect could explain their current orbits. We thus implemented two models of comet-like non-gravitational forces based on water or CO sublimation. The first model assumed quasi-continuous, comet-like activity after separation, which suggested a formation time of the asteroid pair $300^{+120}_{-70}$ yr ago. The second model assumed short-term activity for up to one heliocentric orbit (~13.9 yr) after separation, which suggested that the pair formed 272 \u00b1 7 yr ago. Image stacks showed no activity for 2019 PR2 during its last perihelion passage. These results strongly argue for a common origin that makes these objects the youngest asteroid pair known to date. Questions remain regarding whether these objects derived from a parent comet or asteroid, and how activity may have evolved since their separation.", "title": ["Recent formation and likely cometary activity of near-Earth asteroid pair 2019 PR2-2019 QR6"], "year": "2022"}

{"abstract": "The density of near earth asteroids is a fundamental property which can illuminate the structure of the asteroid and is key in assessing the risk of an impact of an NEA with Earth. A low density can be indicative of a rubble pile structure whereas a higher density can imply a monolith and/or a higher metal content. Since the damage resulting from an impact of an asteroid with Earth depends on its interior structure and its total mass, density is a key parameter to understanding the risk of asteroid impact. Unfortunately, measuring the density of asteroids is extremely difficult, has only been attempted for a tiny fraction of NEAs and usually results in measurements with large uncertainties. In the absence of density measurements for a specific object, understanding the range and distribution of likely densities can allow for probabilistic assessment of the ensemble risk of an impact of an NEA and permit estimates of the range of reasonable masses for specific object. We have developed a candidate density distribution for near earth asteroids based on measurements of meteorite densities and an assumed range of macroporosities. Bayesian inference and existing near earth asteroid density measurements are used to develop an updated distribution.", "title": ["Density Distribution of Near Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2016"}
{"abstract": "This paper analyzes the current population of known near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and presents statistics on the recoverability of NEAs with both targeted observation campaigns and all-sky surveys. For an asteroid to be observable at a future apparition, given the right geometry, the plane-of-sky uncertainty must be small enough to be covered by a telescope's field of view and the asteroid must be brighter than the detector's limiting magnitude. Since recoverability is a telescope-dependent property, we select two representative instruments that span a wide range of capability and availability: the 1.0 m I52 telescope of the Catalina Sky Survey and the Hyper Suprime-Cam of the 8.2 m Subaru telescope. Based on this choice, we classify asteroids as recoverable, potentially recoverable, and not recoverable depending on whether they could be detected with an I52-class telescope, only with a Subaru-class telescope, or with neither, respectively. Using these definitions, we find that the majority (90%) of NEAs with H &lt; 22 and most (93%) potentially hazardous asteroids are recoverable or potentially recoverable in the next 50 yr. When considering fainter asteroids down to H \u2264 28, about two-thirds of the NEA population and half of the low minimum-orbit intersection distance (MOID) asteroids (MOID \u2264 0.05 au) are either recoverable or potentially recoverable. As of 2019 October 13, the Sentry risk list includes 193 objects with an impact probability greater than 10<SUP>-6</SUP> that are not recoverable.

{"abstract": "The majority of known asteroid diameters are derived from thermal-infrared observations. Diameters are derived using asteroid thermal models that approximate their surface temperature distributions and compare the measured thermal-infrared flux with model-dependent predictions. The most commonly used thermal model is the Near-Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM), which is usually perceived as superior to other models like the Fast-Rotating Model (FRM). We investigate the applicability of the NEATM and the FRM to thermal-infrared observations of Near-Earth Objects using synthetic asteroids with properties based on the real Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) population. We find the NEATM to provide more accurate diameters and albedos than the FRM in most cases, with a few exceptions. The modeling results are barely affected by the physical properties of the objects, but we find a large impact of the solar phase angle on the modeling results. We conclude that the NEATM provides statistically more robust diameter estimates for NEAs observed at solar phase angles less than \u223c65\u00b0, while the FRM provides more robust diameter estimates for solar phase angles greater than \u223c65\u00b0. We estimate that &lt;5% of all NEA diameters and albedos derived up to date are affected by systematic effects that are of the same order of magnitude as the typical thermal model uncertainties.

{"abstract": "Accurate astrometry is crucial for determining orbits of near-Earth-asteroids (NEAs) and therefore better tracking them. This paper reports on a demonstration of 10 mas level astrometric precision on a dozen NEAs using the Pomona College 40 inch telescope, at the JPL\u2019s Table Mountain Facility. We used the technique of synthetic tracking (ST), in which many short-exposure (1 s) images are acquired and then combined in post-processing to track both target asteroid and reference stars across the field of view. This technique avoids the trailing loss and keeps the jitter effects from atmosphere and telescope pointing common between the asteroid and reference stars, resulting in higher astrometric precision than the 100 mas level astrometry from traditional approach of using long exposure images. Treating our ST of near-Earth asteroids as a proxy for observations of future spacecraft while they are downlinking data via their high rate optical communication laser beams, our approach shows precision plane-of-sky measurements can be obtained by the optical ground terminals for navigation.

{"abstract": "(385186) 1994 AW1 is a potentially hazardous asteroid and the first near-Earth asteroid suspected to be a binary [1,2]. It made a close approach to Earth in July 2015 getting as close as 25 lunar distances on the 15th. This flyby was a great opportunity for observations in photometry [3] and radar. Continuous-wave (CW) and Delay-Doppler imaging modes were used, first at Goldstone for the 14-19 July period (0.066-0.700 au), and then by Arecibo for 20-30 July (0.075-0.126 au). A range resolution of 150 m was achieved at Goldstone in bistatic configuration with Green Bank Telescope, while monostatic observations in S-band (2380 MHz, 12.6 cm) at Arecibo were obtained at resolutions of 30 m and 75 m. The rotation period of the primary (2.52 h) and orbital period of the secondary (22 h) derived from optical light curves were confirmed by these observations. The primary is about 600 m in diameter and the secondary is about half of the primary's size. A more recent but relatively distant approach (July 8, 2022; 0.11 au) allowed CW spectra to be obtained at Goldstone [4]. We also obtained new light curves on 2023 January 13-24 while it was at V ~16-17 mag. We used the TRAPPIST-South (I40, Chile) and -North (Z53, Morocco) [5] to gather 10 light curves in total.

{"abstract": "In addition to collisions and gravitational forces, it is now becoming widely acknowledged that photon recoil forces and torques from the asymmetric reflection and thermal re-radiation of sunlight are primary mechanisms that govern the rotational evolution of an asteroid. The Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect causes changes in the rotation rate and pole direction of an irregularly shaped asteroid. We present a simple Monte Carlo method to estimate the range of YORP rotational accelerations acting on a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) without knowledge of its detailed shape, and to estimate its detectability using light-curve observations. The method requires knowledge of an asteroid's orbital properties and size, and assumes that the future observational circumstances of an asteroid have already been thought through. It is verified by application to the observational circumstances of the seven YORP-investigated asteroids, and is then applied to 540 NEAs with NEOWISE and/or other diameter measurements, and to all NEAs using Minor Planet Center Orbit absolute magnitudes. The YORP detectability is found to be a strong function of the combined asteroid orbital and diameter properties, and is independent of the rotation period for NEAs that do not have very fast or slow rotation rates. The median and 1\u03c3 spread of YORP rotational acceleration expected to be acting on a particular NEA (d\u03c9/dt in rad yr<SUP>-2</SUP>) can be estimated from its semimajor axis (a in au), eccentricity (e) and diameter (D in km) by using | {{d\u03c9 } / {dt}} | = 1.20_{ - 0.86}^{ + 1.66} \u00d7 10^{ - 2}( {a^2sqrt{1 - e^2} D^2} )^{ - 1} and/or by using | {{d\u03c9 }/{dt}} | = 1.00_{ - 0.81}^{ + 3.07} \u00d7 10^{ - 2}( {a^2sqrt{1 - e^2} D^2} )^{ - 1} if the diameter is instead estimated from the absolute magnitude by assuming a geometric albedo of 0.1. The length of a light-curve observational campaign required to achieve a 50 per cent probability of detecting the YORP effect in a particular NEA (T_CAM_50 in yr) can be estimated by using T_CAM_50 = 12.5( {a^2sqrt{1 - e^2} D^2} )^{1/2} and/or by using T_CAM_50 = 13.7( {a^2sqrt{1 - e^2} D^2} )^{1 /2} for an absolute-magnitude-estimated diameter. To achieve a 95 per cent YORP-detection probability, these last two relations need to be multiplied by factors of \u223c3.4 and \u223c4.5, respectively. This method and approximate relations will be useful for astronomers who plan to look for YORP rotational acceleration in specific NEAs, and for all-sky surveys that may serendipitously observe NEA light curves.", "title": ["The strength and detectability of the YORP effect in near-Earth asteroids: a statistical approach"], "year": "2013"}

The Earth-crossing class of these NEAs and theoretical geocentric radiants and velocities of their meteor showers were determined and compared with available observational data.

{"abstract": "During its close Earth approach in 2001, the E-class near-Earth Asteroid (33342) 1998 WT24 was the focus of extensive radar, optical, and thermal infrared observations. We present a physical model of this object, estimated from Arecibo and Goldstone radar images that cover multiple rotations and span over 100\u00b0 of sky motion. The asteroid has an equivalent diameter of 415\u00b140 m and a diffuse radar scattering law that is identical in both senses of circular polarization, implying a surface that is extremely rough on centimeter-to-decimeter scales. The shape is dominated by three large basins, which may be impact craters or a relic of past dynamical disruption of the object. Analysis of YORP perturbations on WT24's spin state predicts that the asteroid's spin rate is decreasing at a rate of 2\u00d710 degsyr. Simply extrapolating this rate suggests that the asteroid will despin over the next 150 kyr and was spinning at its surface disruption rate 75 kyr ago, but the rotational evolution of WT24 depends on the surface's thermal properties and probably is more complex than a simple spin-down.", "title": ["Physical properties of near-Earth Asteroid (33342) 1998 WT24"], "year": "2008"}
{"abstract": "We have examined the lifetimes of Near-Earth asteroids (NEA's) by directly computing the collision probabilities with other asteroids and with the terrestrial planets. We compare these to the dynamical lifetimes, and to collisional lifetimes assumed by other workers. We discuss the implications of the differences. The lifetimes of NEA's are important because, along with the statistics of craters on the Earth and Moon, they help us to compute the number of NEA's and the rate at which new NEA's are brought to the vicinity of the Earth. Assuming that the NEA population is in steady-state, the lifetimes determine the flux of new bodies needed to replenish the population. Earlier estimates of the lifetimes ignored (or incompletely accounted for) the differences in the velocities of asteroids as they move in their orbits, so our results differ from (for example) Greenberg and Chapman (1983, Icarus 55, 455) and Wetherill (1988, Icarus 76, 1) by factors of 2 to 10. We have computed the collision rates and relative velocities of NEA's with each other, the main-belt asteroids, and the terrestrial planets, using the corrected method described by Bottke et. al. (1992, GRL, in press). We find that NEA's typically have shorter collisional lifetimes than do main-belt asteroids of the same size, due to their high eccentricities, which typically give them aphelia in the main belt. Consequently, they spend a great deal of time in the main belt, and are moving much slower than the bodies around them, making them 'sitting ducks' for impacts with other asteroids. They cross the paths of many objects, and their typical collision velocities are much higher (10-15 km/s) than the collision velocities (5 km/s) among objects within the main belt. These factors combine to give them substantially shorter lifetimes than had been previously estimated.", "title": ["Collision Lifetimes and Impact Statistics of Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "1993"}
{"abstract": "The concept of fast solar sail rendezvous missions to near Earth asteroids is presented by considering the hyperbolic launch excess velocity as a design parameter. After introducing an initial constraint on the hyperbolic excess velocity, a time optimal control framework is derived and solved by using an indirect method. The coplanar circular orbit rendezvous scenario is investigated first to evaluate the variational trend of the transfer time with respect to different hyperbolic excess velocities and solar sail characteristic accelerations. The influence of the asteroid orbital inclination and eccentricity on the transfer time is studied in a parametric way. The optimal direction and magnitude of the hyperbolic excess velocity are identified via numerical simulations. The found results for coplanar circular scenarios are compared in terms of fuel consumption to the corresponding bi-impulsive transfer of the same flight time, but without using a solar sail. The fuel consumption tradeoff between the required hyperbolic excess velocity and the achievable flight time is discussed. The required total launch mass for a particular solar sail is derived in analytical form. A practical mission application is proposed to rendezvous with the asteroid 99942 Apophis by using a solar sail in combination with the provided hyperbolic excess velocity.", "title": ["Fast solar sail rendezvous mission to near Earth asteroids"], "year": "2014"}

Close-up observations of these objects will drastically increase our knowledge about the overall NEA population. For this reason, a multiple NEA rendezvous mission through solar sailing is investigated, taking advantage of the propellantless nature of this propulsion technology. Considering a spacecraft based on the DLR/ESA Gossamer technology, this work focuses on a method for searching possible sequences of NEA encounters. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through a number of fully-optimised trajectories. The results show that it is possible to visit five NEAs within 10 years with near-term solar-sail technology. Moreover, a study on a reduced NEA database demonstrates the reliability of the approach used, showing that 58% of the sequences found with an approximated trajectory model can be converted into real feasible solar-sail trajectories. Overall, the study shows the effectiveness of the proposed automatic optimisation algorithm, which is able to find solutions for a large number of mission scenarios without any input required from the user.", "title": ["Multiple near-earth asteroid rendezvous mission: Solar-sailing options"], "year": "2018"}

Our photometric measurements confirm the rotation period of the asteroid to be 4.126 \u00b1 0.179 hr, consistent with the previously published value of 4.112 \u00b1 0.001 hr. By combining our visible spectroscopic measurements (0.45-0.93 \u03bcm) with archival MITHNEOS near-infrared spectra (0.78-2.49 \u03bcm), we classify the asteroid as an Xn-type in the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy.

The band area ratio is 1.13 \u00b1 0.05.

Impacts from 10-100 meter size NEAs are not statistically life-threatening, but may cause significant regional damage, while 1-10 meter size NEAs with low velocities relative to Earth are compelling targets for space missions. We describe the implementation and initial results of a real-time NEA-discovery system specialized for the detection of small, high angular rate (visually streaked) NEAs in Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) images.

We refined this method and extend it further to the distance measurement of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). In practice, we measure the distance of the potentially hazardous asteroid (99942) Apophis from the acquired CCD frames using the newly refined method.

The measurement results of Apophis based on the newly refined RRV method show that the mean relative errors for the independent exposure frames on the successive two nights is ~0.08% (about a factor of 2 improvement in comparison with the research of Lin et al.) compared with the distance from JPL ephemeris.

The database contains 6373 accessible NEA missions with maximum mission durations of 6 years in the 2030-2065 timeframe. The accessible asteroids' statistical results show that about 55% of accessible NEAs can provide stay-time of over 4 years in a 6-year mission.

The taxonomy results for accessible asteroids from major taxonomy systems are summarized, and the available resources on these asteroids are analysed based on the taxonomy information.

{"abstract": "Phase curves of asteroids are often interpreted within the context of the properties of the materials present on asteroid surfaces. However, the phase curve of a non-spherical object that undergoes changes in viewing geometry can vary between and during apparitions from the phase curve expected from a spherical body with the same surface material. This means that model parameters used in fits to phase curve data, such as in the HG system [1], can vary depending on the sampling of the observations used to construct the phase curve. We have developed a code, using the Hapke photometric model [2], to estimate the systematic uncertainty introduced into asteroid phase curves due to these changes in aspect [3]. The significance of this effect is shown by re-analysing, using our code, the uncertainties of previously published phase curves for the asteroids (8014) 1990 MF and (19764) 2000 NF5 [4]. The aspect-related uncertainties on the absolute magnitudes are on average 4.5 times higher than the statistical fit uncertainties for these two objects. The propagation of this systematic uncertainty can heavily influence thermal modelling results. A greater than two-fold increase in the uncertainty of the NEATM-derived geometric albedo for (19764) 2000 NF5 is computed. The addition of aspect uncertainty into phase curve derived brightness predictions, that are used to estimate reflected flux contributions in the infrared transition region, can lead to an increase in the percentage uncertainties on these estimations from a few percent to a few tens of percent. We are also using Hapke modelling of phase curves to probe detections of activity from asteroids such as (3200) Phaethon, to investigate the possibility that aspect effects could lead to errors in estimates of excess brightness for these 'active asteroids'. We are evaluating any potential biases this may introduce into calculations of the dust contribution to the Geminid meteor stream by the activity of (3200) Phaethon. <P />[1] Bowell et al., 1989, in Asteroids II, 524 <P />[2] Hapke, 2012, Theory of Reflectance and Emittance Spectroscopy.

{"abstract": "We analyze a sample of 139 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), defined as those that reach perihelion distances q&lt;1.3 au, and that also fulfill the conditions of approaching or crossing Jupiter\u2019s orbit (aphelion distances Q&gt;4.8 au), having Tisserand parameters 2&lt;T&lt;3 and orbital periods P&lt;20 yr. In order to compare the dynamics, we also analyze a sample of 42 Jupiter family comets (JFCs) in near-Earth orbits, i.e. with q&lt;1.3 au. We integrated the orbits of these two samples for 10<SUP>4</SUP> yr in the past and in the future. We find that the great majority of the NEAs move on stable orbits during the considered period, and that a large proportion of them are in one of the main mean motion resonances with Jupiter, in particular the 2:1. We find a strong coupling between the perihelion distance and the inclination in the motion of most NEAs, due to Kozai mechanism, that generates many sungrazers. On the other hand, most JFCs are found to move on very unstable orbits, showing large variations in their perihelion distances in the last few 10<SUP>2</SUP>-10<SUP>3</SUP> yr, which suggests a rather recent capture in their current near-Earth orbits. Even though most NEAs of our sample move in typical \u2018asteroidal\u2019 orbits, we detect a small group of NEAs whose orbits are highly unstable, resembling those of the JFCs. These are: 1997 SE5, 2000 DN1, 2001 XQ, 2002 GJ8, 2002 RN38, 2003 CC11, 2003 WY25, 2009 CR2, and 2011 OL51. These objects might be inactive comets, and indeed 2003 WY25 has been associated with comet Blanpain, and it is now designed as Comet 289P/Blanpain. Under the assumption that these objects are inactive comets, we can set an upper limit of \u223c0.17 to the fraction of NEAs with Q&gt;4.8 au of cometary origin, but it could be even lower if the NEAs in unstable orbits listed before turn out to be bona fide asteroids from the main belt. This study strengthens the idea that NEAs and comets essentially are two distinct populations, and that periods of dormancy in comets must be rare. Most likely, active comets in near-Earth orbits go through a continuous erosion process in successive perihelion passages until disintegration into meteoritic dust and fragments of different sizes. In this scenario, 289P/Blanpain might be a near-devolatized fragment from a by now disintegrated parent comet.", "title": ["Assessing the physical nature of near-Earth asteroids through their dynamical histories"], "year": "2014"}
{"title": ["NEARCube: using autonomous 3U CubeSats to flyby near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2018", "abstract": "CubeSat technology is rapidly evolving and now the first missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) have been planned [1-4]. These first 6U interplanetary CubeSats (&lt;12 kg) will be launched using NASA's Atlas V and its new Space Launch System (SLS), and are designed to observe and land on the Moon, flyby a near-Earth asteroid, flyby Mars in support of NASA's InSight mission, and more.The use of CubeSats for planetary exploration represents an attractive solution to reduce the development and implementation costs of missions in comparison to traditional spacecraft [5]. However, ground segment operations--which require extensive workforce and the use of large, costly ground stations such as the Deep Space Network (DSN)--remain as one of the key challenges for interplanetary CubeSats, and still represent a very significant (sometimes inviable) fraction of the mission budgets [6]. In response to the current interest in understanding the potential of CubeSats and possible applications for planetary exploration, this work studies the feasibility of autonomously flying by a near-Earth asteroid using a 3U CubeSat (&lt;4 kg).The proposed mission, which is named Near-Earth Asteroid Reconnaissance using CubeSats (NEARCube), is therefore envisioned as a feasibility demonstration of small-body exploration missions using autonomous and smaller CubeSats than ever before. Considering the current state of CubeSat technology, this work evaluates the flyby altitudes that can be achieved by autonomous CubeSats, and assesses the potential scientific impact that such a mission could have. If proven possible, autonomous 3U CubeSats could provide a low-cost solution to support current efforts to determine initial stages of solar system formation through asteroid exploration (or the primordial sources of organic matter if used for cometary exploration) [13], they could be used to identify potential targets for future missions, to complement the scientific objectives of larger missions, or to support the emerging asteroid mining industry [14], etc.The NEARCube mission specifically considers the possibility of deploying a CubeSat from a larger spacecraft in a periodic orbit around the first (L1) or the second (L2) Sun-Earth Lagrange points. These points provide a prime location to observe the Sun and outer space, and have been extensively used in the past by mission such as SOHO, Herschel, Planck, or LISA Pathfinder [7-10]. The James Webb Space Telescope (2019) and Euclid (2020) missions will be launched to L2 in the upcoming years as well [11, 12]. In addition, the span of the mission is limited here to 150 days to confine the demanding implications and systems requirements of long-duration, deep-space travel, and the spacecraft is primarily designed using currently-available off-the-shelf components (for reduced development and implementation costs).This study is comprised of three overarching parts: (1) a trajectory design and target selection analysis to understand if 3U CubeSats can travel far enough to encounter a near-Earth asteroid, and to identify asteroids that could be flown by in the upcoming years, (2) a navigation and sensitivity analysis to study if a CubeSat could autonomously estimate its position and velocity, and to characterize the accuracy of the flybys and attainable flyby altitudes, and (3) a systems engineering analysis to propose a 3U CubeSat design, recommend potential science payloads, and assess the measurements and scientific objectives that could be accomplished by such a mission.Preliminary results show that a total of 11 near-Earth asteroids (larger than 100 meters) could be encountered between 2019 and 2025, out of which 6 could be flown by a 3U CubeSat performing autonomous navigation. Flyby altitudes of 500 km are found to be possible with currently available components and an allocated space of approximately 0.8U for the science payload. A variety of scientific instruments are available (including off-the-shelf components), and proposed here for the NEARCube mission. Potential scientific objectives are also assessed, and include performing ultraviolet, visible or infrared imaging spectroscopy, measurements of remnant magnetic fields, or even mass spectroscopy if used for cometary exploration.This work therefore identifies an opportunity for small-body planetary science using autonomous 3U CubeSats. The mission concept, upcoming asteroid flyby opportunities, and potential scientific merit of the proposed NEARCube mission are presented and discussed here in detail. <P />References[1] Singer, J., Pelfrey, J., Norris, G., 2017.

{"abstract": "The polarization state of radar echoes from planetary bodies contains information about the scattering mechanisms present on the surface and thus the near-surface physical properties. Polarimetric radar scatter from complex surfaces, such as those observed for spacecraft-visited near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), is not well understood in terms of relating observed polarimetry to surface properties. Here we present an improved methodology for polarimetric analyses of ground-based radar observations of NEAs, extending techniques derived for larger bodies. We calculate the Stokes vector for delay-Doppler images of NEAs and use this to perform the m-chi decomposition and derive polarimetric products such as the degree of polarization, circular polarization ratio, and degree of linear polarization. We apply this methodology to radar observations of NEAs (53319) 1999 JM<SUB>8</SUB>, (101955) Bennu, and (33342) 1998 WT<SUB>24</SUB> obtained by the Arecibo Observatory. We also perform numerical simulations of the m-chi decomposition for irregular boulders to augment the interpretation of the results for NEAs. Our analyses show that significant components of radar echoes are depolarized (random polarization) and linearly polarized. The numerical simulations confirm that depolarization is increased by single scattering from nonspherical wavelength-scale particles. Our analysis suggests that 1999 JM<SUB>8</SUB> is possibly covered in regolith and that surface scatterers dominate the scattering properties of Bennu. The NEA 1998 WT<SUB>24</SUB> displays diverse polarimetric properties, which we reconcile with optical and thermal observations by assuming a fine-grained regolith mantling a rugged, dense interior. In this work, we demonstrate the usefulness of radar polarimetry in characterizing the physical properties of planetary surfaces.", "title": ["Polarimetric Decomposition of Near-Earth Asteroids Using Arecibo Radar Observations"], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "We report radar, photometric, and spectroscopic observations of near-Earth Asteroid (136617) 1994 CC. The radar measurements were obtained at Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) and Arecibo (2380 MHz, 12.6 cm) on 9 days following the asteroid's approach within 0.0168 AU on June 10, 2009. 1994 CC was also observed with the Panchromatic Robotic Optical Monitoring and Polarimetry Telescopes (PROMPT) on May 21 and June 1-3. Visible-wavelength spectroscopy was obtained with the 5-m Hale telescope at Palomar on August 25. Delay-Doppler radar images reveal that 1994 CC is a triple system; along with (153591) 2001 SN263, this is only the second confirmed triple in the near-Earth population. Photometry obtained with PROMPT yields a rotation period for the primary P = 2.38860 \u00b1 0.00009 h and a lightcurve amplitude of \u223c0.1 mag suggesting a shape with low elongation. Hale telescope spectroscopy indicates that 1994 CC is an Sq-class object. Delay-Doppler radar images and shape modeling reveal that the primary has an effective diameter of 0.62 \u00b1 0.06 km, low pole-on elongation, few obvious surface features, and a prominent equatorial ridge and sloped hemispheres that closely resemble those seen on the primary of binary near-Earth Asteroid (66391) 1999 KW4. Detailed orbit fitting reported separately by Fang et al. (Fang, J., Margot, J.-L., Brozovic, M., Nolan, M.C., Benner, L.A.M., Taylor, P.A. [2011]. Astron. J. 141, 154-168) gives a mass of the primary of 2.6 \u00d7 10 <SUP>11</SUP> kg that, coupled with the effective diameter, yields a bulk density of 2.1 \u00b1 0.6 g cm <SUP>-3</SUP>. The images constrain the diameters of the inner and outer satellites to be 113 \u00b1 30 m and 80 \u00b1 30 m, respectively. The inner satellite has a semimajor axis of \u223c1.7 km (\u223c5.5 primary radii), an orbital period of \u223c30 h, and its Doppler dispersion suggests relatively slow rotation, 26 \u00b1 12 h, consistent with spin-orbit lock. The outer satellite has an orbital period of \u223c9 days and a rotation period of 14 \u00b1 7 h, establishing that the rotation is not spin-orbit locked. Among all binary and triple systems observed by radar, at least 25% (7/28) have a satellite that rotates more rapidly than its orbital period. This suggests that asynchronous configurations with P<SUB>rotation</SUB> &lt; P<SUB>orbital</SUB> are relatively common among multiple systems in the near-Earth population. 1994 CC's outer satellite has an observed maximum separation from the primary of \u223c5.7 km (\u223c18.4 primary radii) that is the largest separation relative to primary radius seen to date among all 36 known binary and triple NEA systems. 1994 CC, (153591) 2001 SN263, and 1998 ST27 are the only triple and binary systems known with satellite separations &gt;10 primary radii, suggesting either a detection bias, or that such widely-separated satellites are relatively uncommon in NEA multiple systems.", "title": ["Radar and optical observations and physical modeling of triple near-Earth Asteroid (136617) 1994 CC"], "year": "2011"}
{"abstract": "Reflectance spectra of C-type near-Earth asteroid 162173 1999 JU3 were acquired on UT 2007 July 11, September 10 and 11. An absorption feature centered near 0.7 \u03bcm, and associated with the presence of iron-bearing phyllosilicates, is seen in the 2007 July 11 spectrum. The 2007 September spectrum shows a shallow absorption feature centered near 0.6 \u03bcm. In contrast, the reflectance spectrum of 162173 1999 JU3 obtained during its discovery apparition has no absorption feature, suggesting that the asteroid's surface covers the conjunction of two different geological units. The variation in the presence and absence of these features in reflectance spectra of the surface material of C-type asteroids is observed among main-belt asteroids. As the target for the planned Japanese mission Hayabusa 2, 162173 1999 JU3 could represent a sample of aqueously altered early solar system material.

{"abstract": "In September 1993, we initiated a regular program of photometric observations of Near-Earth objects. Since that time we have been allocated 5-7 nights per month at the 42'' Hall telescope at Anderson Mesa. There are three goals of our observing program for each asteroid: (1) to obtain an accurate rotation period and characterization of the lightcurve, (2) to obtain the surface color, and (3) to measure the photometric parameters, H and G. All of the lightcurve observations are made in Kron-Cousins R and we always obtain a V-R color. Limited ECAS colors are also obtained when the objects are bright enough. We have secured periods for 9 asteroids, 1864 Daedalus, 1866 Sisyphus, 3200 Phaethon, 4954 Eric, 5693 (1993 EA), 5836 (1993 MF), 6489 (1991 JX), 1993 QP, and 1993 WD. Some of these periods are a confimation of an earlier result but most are new. We obtained colors for all these objects as well as four additional asteroids, 5407 (1992 AX), 1993 UC, 1993 VW, and 1994 LW. We have additional (as yet unreduced) observations of 2062 Aten, 2212 Hephaistos, 3752 Camillo, 5143 Heracles, 5863 (1983 RB), 6053 (1993 BW3), 7025 (1993 QA), 7092 (1992 LC), 1989 VA, 1992 TC, 1994 RC, and 1995 YA3. The fastest rotation period we find is 2.402 hours for 1866 Sisyphus and the slowest is 93QP at ~ 24 hours. The colors for these objects range from V-R=0.34 for 3200 Phaethon to V-R=0.49 for 1866 Sisyphus and 4954 Eric. Most colors fall near V-R=0.43.

{"abstract": "It is now accepted that some near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) may be dormant or dead comets. One strong indicator of cometary nature is the existence of an associated meteoroid stream with its consequent observed meteor showers. We identify a complex of four NEAs (1997GL3, 2000PG3, 2002GM2, and 2002JC9) which have very similar orbits and a likely common progenitor. We also calculate the theoretical parameters for any meteor shower that may be associated with this complex. Finally we carried out of a search of existing catalogues of meteor showers and found that activity has been observed corresponding to each of the theoretically predicted showers. We conclude that the complex of four NEAs is the result of a cometary break-up.", "title": ["Near-Earth asteroids among the Piscids meteoroid stream"], "year": "2008"}
{"abstract": "Thermal infrared observations of the near-Earth asteroids 2100 Ra-Shalom and 1991 EE are presented and interpreted with the aid of published asteroid thermal models. The broad wavelength range covered allows the best fitting of a family of model spectra to be selected, eliminating the ambiguity associated with deriving model parameters from observations at just one or two thermal wavelengths. Neither the \u201cstandard\u201d thermal model nor the \u201cfast rotating\u201d model provide good fits to the thermal spectra. Much improved fits are obtained with a modified standard thermal model with values of the model \u201cbeaming\u201d parameter, \u03b7, significantly higher than normally assumed in the standard thermal model. The results for the Aten asteroid 2100 Ra-Shalom provide convincing confirmation that this object has an unusually high surface thermal inertia. The resulting optical albedos (on theH,Gmagnitude system) and effective diameters are 0.13 \u00b1 0.04 and 2.48 \u00b1 0.35 km for 2100 Ra-Shalom (near lightcurve maximum) and 0.30 \u00b1 0.10 and 1.01 \u00b1 0.15 km for 1991 EE (referred to the lightcurve mean magnitude). The derived size for 2100 Ra-Shalom is consistent with previous estimates but the moderate albedo, coupled with infrared colors more typical of S-types, leads us to question its classification as C-type. These are the first size and albedo determinations for the Apollo asteroid 1991 EE.

{"abstract": "Orbit determination for Near-Earth Asteroids presents unique technical challenges due to the imperative of early detection and careful assessment of the risk posed by specific Earth close approaches. This article presents a case study of asteroid 99942 Apophis, a 300-400 meter object that, for a short period in December 2004, held an impact probability of more than 2% in 2029. Now, with an orbit based on radar ranging and more than a year of optical observations, we can confidently say that it will pass safely by the Earth in 2029, although at a distance of only about six Earth radii from the geocenter. However, the extremely close nature of this encounter acts to obscure the trajectory in subsequent years, when resonant returns to the vicinity of the Earth are possible. In particular, an impact possibility in the year 2036 has a roughly 5% probability of persisting through the very favorable 2013 radar and optical observing apparition. In the event that the 2036 potential impact has not been eliminated by 2013, a precise characterization of the Yarkovsky accelerations acting on the asteroid may become an important part of the orbit estimation and impact prediction problem. Even so, the sixteen years available to effect a deflection from 2013 until 2029, after which the problem would become intractable, are sufficient to respond to the threat should a deflection effort become warranted.", "title": ["Potential impact detection for Near-Earth asteroids: the case of 99942 Apophis (2004 MN 4 )"], "year": "2006"}

This observation was requested by the DESTINY<SUP>+</SUP> mission team, which plans to conduct a flyby of asteroid Phaethon in 2028. Overall, this research effort contributes towards a large-scale observation campaign with a total of 72 observers observing from western Japan to southern Korea. 36 stations were established, and stellar occultation by the asteroid Phaethon was detected in 18 of them. This is the first time that this many multiple chord observations have been made for such a small asteroid (it has a diameter of 5-6 km). Observational reductions show that the apparent cross-section of Phaethon at the time of the occultation could be approximated using an ellipse with a major diameter of 6.12 \u00b1 0.07 km and a minor diameter of 4.14 \u00b1 0.07 km, and a position angle of 117.\u00b04 \u00b1 1.\u00b05. As can be seen from the small error bars of the fitted ellipse, we have succeeded in estimating the shape and size of the asteroid with an extremely high degree of accuracy. Our observation results, together with other observations, will be used to create a 3D model of Phaethon and to improve its orbit. The instruments that we used for this observation are commonly used by many amateur astronomers in Japan for occultation observations and are not difficult to obtain.

{"abstract": "Photometric observations of the nearly equal-mass binary near-Earth asteroid 2017 YE5 were carried out at the Observat\u00f3rio Astron\u00f4mico do Sert\u00e3o de Itaparica (OASI, Brazil) and at the Blue Mountains Observatory (BMO, Australia) between 2018 July and August, shortly after it made a close approach to Earth in 2018 June. These observations allowed to determine an orbital period of the system in good agreement with the result of the radar observations. Our results also indicate that the 2017 YE5 system is not fully locked in a synchronous spin-orbit resonance, as there is a possible asynchronous component or tumbling rotator in the system. Additional data obtained at the Observatorio Astron\u00f3mico Nacional de San Pedro M\u00e1rtir (OAN-SPM, Mexico) in 2018 August allowed to derive the colour indices and the low-resolution spectrum, which indicate that the object has a very reddish surface similar to the outer Solar system objetcs. This is consistent with a dark albedo of about 3 per cent, derived from an effective diameter of the combined components and an absolute magnitude of 19.2. Infrared data obtained at the NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility exhibit a thermal emission in the 2.5 $\\mu$m range for which a low albedo of 2-4 per cent was adjusted by applying a thermal model. Regarding to the taxonomic classification, we found that the 2017 YE5 is a D-type in the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy.

This results in a poor fit to the thermal-infrared observations if its effective diameter is kept fixed in the model fitting. <BR /> Conclusions: The thermal inertia derived for Geographos is slightly higher than the typical values for a near-Earth asteroid of its size, and its derived bulk density suggests a rubble-pile interior structure.

{"abstract": "We present a general and significant relation between the spectral slope of silicate-rich asteroids (both main-belt and near-Earth asteroids) and the exposure to space weathering, computed taking into account the age and the distance from the Sun. We find strong evidence for the existence of a slope-distance relation that may identify the dominant space-weathering processes as Sun-related. In turn, the age estimates depend on various parameters and in particular on the effectiveness of the Yarkovsky-driven orbital mobility.

{"title": ["Phase Curve Variability of near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2021", "abstract": "1. BackgroundThe nature of asteroid phase curves is typically explained solely by the scattering properties of atmosphereless particulate surfaces. Models such as the H, G [1] and H, G1, G2 [2] systems aim to approximate the behaviour of these scattering properties without any assumption of the physical processes involved. However, these and other models are unable to account for changes in disk-integrated brightness of asteroids due to changing viewing aspect geometry during and between apparitions. If the viewing geometry of an asteroid changes rapidly, then the change in the cross-sectional area visible by the observer can impart modulations to the phase curve, becoming more significant for elongated asteroids [3]. These effects are likely to be significant for asteroids that undergo large changes to viewing aspect during apparitions, i.e. the near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs). Shape-induced modulations to phase curves limit the taxonomic information that can be extracted from parameters such as G, or G1 &amp; G2. In this work we are aiming to characterise the magnitude of these shape effects, and investigate the potential error introduced into interpretation of individual phase curves.2. Modelling Phase Curve VariabilityTo study this effect, we have simulated asteroid phase curves for a variety of shapes over different geometries. Figure 1 describes one of these geometries that has the Earth kept fixed, with the asteroid sweeping past from south to north during a close approach with the Earth. We create ellipsoidal models, with a spherical model as a control, with differing pole orientations. The rotationally averaged reduced magnitudes for points along the orbit are simulated using a Hapke scattering model [4], using assumed S-type parameters based on (433) Eros [5].We note significant deviations from the spherical model for elongated objects over these geometries and observe clear separation of pre- and post-opposition phase curves for certain pole orientations (Figure 2). The large differences between these phase curves and the spherical model at high phase angles indicate that taxonomic information may be far more limited in individual phase curves of NEAs than previously thought. Using a single parameter taxonomic fitting method [6] we obtain a classification for the pre-opposition phase curve in Figure 2(c) as C-type, and for the post-opposition phase curve we obtain an E-type classification. The taxonomic classification using this method changes entirely based on when the asteroid is observed. The separation of the phase curve in Figure 2(c) is significantly larger at higher phase angles, underscoring the importance of this effect in NEA phase curves.3. Observational Detection of Phase Curve VariabilityPhase curve variability has been detected in rotationally averaged calibrated photometry from the PIRATE telescope of NEA (159402) 1999 AP10 over a single apparition from 2020-07-29 to 2021-01-24 (Figure 3). PIRATE is a 0.43m aperture telescope located at Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife. These observations were conducted as part of an ongoing NEA observation and facility characterisation project [7]. A convex shape model is constructed from the uncalibrated PIRATE photometric data and additional archival data from ALCDEF [8]. Using simulations of the phase curve over this apparition using the convex model and assumed S-type Hapke parameters we verify that the variability in the phase curve is a result of aspect changes during the apparition.4. Future WorkFurther work will investigate the potential impact of shape modulations to phase curves in the formulation and optimisation of the basis functions in phase curve models. Methods for extracting taxonomic information from phase curves with potential shape modifications will need to be developed to continue to aid the classification of NEAs from photometric data in existing and upcoming datasets (e.g. LSST).References[1] Bowell et al. 1989, in Asteroids II, 524[2] Muinonen et al. 2010, Icarus, 209, 542[3] Rozitis et al. 2020, Bulletin of the AAS, 52(6)[4] Hapke 1984, Icarus, 59, 41[5] Li et al. 2004, Icarus, 172, 415[6] Penttil\u00e4 et al. 2016, Planetary and Space Science, 123, 117[7] Jackson et al. 2021, submitted to PASP[8] Stephens et al. 2018, AAS, DPS Meeting #50, id 417.03."}

{"abstract": "Hazards due to near-Earth objects (NEOs) continue to pose a threat to life on Earth. While our capability for discovering NEOs has steadily progressed over the last three decades, physical characterization of a representative population has lagged behind. To test the operational readiness of the global planetary defense capabilities, we conducted a community-led global planetary defense exercise, with support from the NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), to test the operational readiness of global planetary defense capabilities. This campaign focused on the characterization (direct imaging, radar, spectroscopy) of the binary near-Earth asteroid (NEA) (66391) Moshup (formerly known as 1999 KW4) and its moon Squannit. We chose a binary system because roughly one in six large NEAs are binaries. An additional goal was to apply lessons learned from this campaign towards ground-based characterization campaign for binary NEA (65803) Didymos, the target of the PDCO's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) and the European Space Agency's Hera missions. Spectral observations of Moshup from the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) show similarities to Q-type asteroids. Based on its spectral band parameters, the best meteorite analogs for Moshup are L chondrites. We did not detect a hydration feature at 3 \u03bcm, which suggests that the entire surface is anhydrous. We imaged the binary using the SPHERE instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and obtained resolved spectral measurements of Moshup similar to those obtained with the NASA IRTF. Squannit appears to have slightly redder spectral slope than Moshup. Radar observations Arecibo Observatory at 2380 MHz indicate a polarization ratio of ~0.4, which is higher than the average values for the S complex asteroids, which includes Q types. The visible extent of the components from the radar observations, taken as proxies for their radii, suggest Moshup and Squannit have diameters of 1500 \u00b1 120 m and 480 \u00b1 60 m, respectively. We constrain the system mass to 2.2 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 10<SUP>12</SUP> kg with a maximum range for bulk density between ~0.8 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP> for a very low-mass system with spherical shapes up to 2.7 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP> for very high-mass system where Moshup has a more ridged-ball shape. We note that the radar-derived parameters presented in the paper are for the purposes of this exercise and do not supersede those in Ostro et al. (2006). We assessed the impact risk of a hypothetical impactor based on Moshup's physical properties using the Probabilistic Asteroid Impact Risk (PAIR) model. We assessed three impact risk scenarios at different epochs as the state of knowledge of Moshup improved. For kilometer-scale impactors like Moshup, the risk is driven predominantly by the potential for global climatic effects (95-97% of cases across the epochs) with a few percent driven by local damage and a few tenths of a percent driven by tsunami.", "title": ["Near-earth asteroid (66391) Moshup (1999 KW4) observing campaign: Results from a global planetary defense characterization exercise"], "year": "2022"}

{"abstract": "The Near-Earth Asteroid Kamo'oalewa (469219) is exceptional among the small population of Earth's co-orbitals due to its recurrent transitions between quasi-satellite and horseshoe orbital states, persisting over megayears as revealed by numerical simulations. The reflectance spectrum of this asteroid as measured by Sharkey et al. (2021), shows a similarity with lunar silicates, which, together with its very Earth-like orbit, suggests a possible origin of Kamo'oalewa as a Lunar-Ejecta from a meteroidal impact. We explore with numerical simulations the dynamical behavior of particles with a large range of launch conditions from the surface of the Moon. These launched particles face a dynamical barrier for entry into Earth's co-orbital space. However, a small fraction reach co-orbital states, some resembling Kamo'oalewa's orbital behavior with persistent transitions between quasi-satellite and horseshoe orbits. The favored launch conditions for such outcomes are launch velocities slightly above the lunar escape velocity, and launch locations from the Moon's trailing hemisphere. Furthermore, we find that Kamo'oalewa's inclination may have been boosted by repeated close approaches with Earth. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that Kamo'oalewa could indeed have originated as lunar ejecta. These findings also suggest that many lunar ejecta remain to be discovered among near-Earth asteroids. Dynamical pathways taken by lunar ejecta are complex and worthy of deeper investigation.

{"abstract": "Formed from a catastrophic collision of a parent body larger than 150 km in diameter, the Flora family is located in the innermost part of the main belt near the {\u03bd }<SUB>6</SUB> secular resonance. Objects in this region, when pushed onto planet-crossing orbits, tend to have relatively high probabilities of striking the Earth. These factors suggest that Flora may be a primary source of present-day LL chondrite-like NEOs and Earth/Moon impactors. To investigate this possibility, we used collisional and dynamical models to track the evolution of Flora family members. We created an initial Flora family and followed test asteroids 1 and 3 km in diameter using a numerical code that accounted for both planetary perturbations and nongravitational effects. Our Flora family members reproduce the observed semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination distributions of the real family after \u2243 1 to 1.4 Gyr. A consistency with the surface age inferred from crater spatial densities found on (951) Gaspra may favor the latter age. Our combined collisional and dynamical runs indicate that the family has lost nearly 90% of its initial kilometer-sized members. At its peak, 100{--}300 {Myr} after the family-forming event, Flora family members filled NEO space with nearly 1000 D\u2265slant 1 {km} size bodies before fading to its present contribution of 35-50 such NEOs.

In the preliminary design of asteroid missions, such as M-ARGO, the target selection is an essential and critical task. In this context, the present work aims to find the reachable NEA targets considering the performances and constraints of M-ARGO mission. M-ARGO is planned to be released around the second Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L2. From this orbit, M-ARGO will make its own deep-space transfer to a designated NEA target using a miniaturised electric propulsion system. In order to generate a set of reachable targets, an original procedure was developed. Hundreds of both time- and fuel-optimal low-thrust trajectory optimisation problems have been solved with an indirect approach, targeting asteroids pre-filtered from the Minor Planet Center Database. The method implements a realistic thruster model, featuring variable input power, thrust, and specific impulse, together with an accurate switching detection technique and analytic derivatives. The analysis shows that approximately 150 minor bodies are found potentially reachable by M-ARGO when departing from the Sun-Earth Lagrange point within a 3-year transfer duration. The potentially reachable targets are then ranked and processed manually, considering technological requirements and contraints. This final screening led to a subset of promising 41 targets.

{"abstract": "The Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) 2008BO16, 2011EC41, and 2013CT36 (http://newton.dm.\\unipi.it/neodys, 2013) have very similar orbits according to the D_{SH} criterion of Southworth, Hawkins (1963). Additionally, their orbits are classed as comet-like by the Tisserand invariant values (Kresak 1982; Kosai 1992). The orbital evolution investigation shows, that during one cycle of variations of the argument of perihelion omega, the asteroids cross the Earth\u2019s orbit four times. Consequently, a developed meteoroid stream, possible associated with them, might produce four meteor showers (Babadzhanov, Obrubov 1992). Theoretical parameters of the predicted showers were calculated and identified with the observable nighttime sigma-Capricornids (Sekanina 1973; Jenniskens 2006) and chi-Sagittarids (Sekanina 1976), and daytime chi-Capricornids (Sekanina 1976) and Capricornids-Sagittarids (Sekanina 1973) meteor showers. The similar and comet-like orbits and association with the meteoroid stream producing four active showers are strong indications that these asteroids have a common cometary origin. Earlier the NEAs (2101) Adonis and 1995CS, which additionally is potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA), were recognized as dormant comets because of their link with the same meteoroid stream (Babadzhanov 2003). So, a conclusion was made, that either the considered NEAs are large sized splinters of the Adonis, or all five objects are fragments of a larger comet that was the parent body of the sigma-Capricornids meteoroid stream, and whose break-up occurred several tens of thousands years ago. During 2010-2011 years three fireballs were photographed by the Tajikistan fireball network (Babadzhanov, Kokhirova 2009), belonging to the sigma-Capricornids meteor shower. Taking into account the observations else six fireballs of this shower in the Canada and USA (Halliday et al. 1996; McCrosky et al. 1978), the mean radiant coordinates, the period of activity, as well as the mean daily radiant drift of the sigma-Capricornids were determined. Further to the PE criterion (Ceplecha, McCrosky 1976), the values of bulk density of the nine fireball producing meteoroids are in the range 0.2-3.5 g cm(-3) that suggests a non-homogeneous compound of the comet-progenitor of the sigma-Capricornids fireball shower. size{ References Babadzhanov, P.B., 2003, A&amp;A,397, 319 Babadzhanov, P.B., Kokhirova, G.I., 2009, Izv.

{"abstract": "The Yarkovsky effect is the most important non-gravitational perturbation affecting the dynamics of asteroids smaller than about 30 km. It is a thermal effect caused by non-isotropic re-emission of heat, and it mainly produces a drift in the semimajor axis. This perturbation is typically small, and its estimation can be attempted by means of orbit determination only under certain circumstances, i.e. when the observational arc is long enough and the observations are of good quality. Estimating the Yarkovsky effect is useful for different reasons. For instance, it can help in the physical characterization of asteroids, or in determining global properties of the near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) population. From a planetary defence point of view, it is fundamental to correctly evaluate the impact threat of a NEA, because the Yarkovsky effect may change the location of the impact keyhole. Several previous works were dedicated to the determination of the Yarkovsky effect on NEAs, however an automatic procedure for the update of the catalogue is not in place yet. In this work, we present an algorithm for the automatic detection of the Yarkovsky effect on NEAs. The procedure is based on three steps: 1) shortlist of candidates for Yarkovsky detection; 2) orbit determination on the shortlisted candidates; 3) validation of the detections. Step 1 is done by estimating a probability density function (PDF) of the expected Yarkovsky semi-major axis drift, and an NEA is shortlisted by using a statistical criterion. At Step 2, the orbit determination is similar to that of Farnocchia et al. 2013. Finally, at step 3) a detection is accepted or rejected by using again a statistical comparison based on the expected drift of Step 1. Among the known NEAs, the algorithm identified 361 positive Yarkovsky effect detections, increasing the current set by about 25%. The automatization of this process is a crucial step in light of the beginning of the operational activities of new surveys such as the LSST and the ESA Flyeye Telescope, and the availability of new large sets of data opens up new possibilities in asteroid research. The procedure is now adopted by the ESA NEO Coordination Centre, and data are automatically made available on the web portal (<A href=\"https://neo.ssa.esa.int/\">https://neo.ssa.esa.int/</A>).", "title": ["A new era in the Yarkovsky effect detection on near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2023"}
{"abstract": "We present results from a program of optical light curve observations of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) with diameters under 1 km, designed to detect, and determine the distribution of, rotation periods shorter than a few hours. We obtain measurements or estimates of rotation period P for approximately one third of the 83 NEAs observed. Most of the measured periods are in the fast-rotating asteroid (FRA) regime (P &lt; 2 h). We assess our detection sensitivity using simulated light curves and a new Monte Carlo algorithm (SALSA), which allows us to de-bias the counts of detected FRAs and determine the fraction of objects that are fast rotators as a function of H. We find that the FRA fraction F rises sharply from zero to a value statistically consistent with unity from H = 21.4 to H = 23.6, a span corresponding to a factor of only 2.8 in nominal diameter. Almost nothing larger than 170 m, and almost everything smaller than 60 m, is a fast rotator, assuming a mean S class albedo of 0.17. The formal 95% confidence limits are F &lt; 13% for 18.5 &lt; H &lt; 21.4 and F &gt; 56% for 23.6 &lt; H &lt; 26.3. Relative to a distribution with the same FRA fraction that is uniform in frequency (as implied by models of evolution following the YORP cycle) up to a size-dependent upper cutoff, the actual spin distribution extends to shorter periods. Approximately two thirds of our sample shows ambiguous light curves from which no period estimate can be obtained. Finite photometric errors account for some of these, but do not explain the steep increase in the ambiguous fraction toward larger objects, which suggests an increase in the actual fraction of very slow rotators, very fast rotators, or nearly axisymmetric objects. With a significantly larger data set, our fully general SALSA procedure will be able to extract the NEA spin rate distribution as a function of absolute magnitude H. Determining this distribution to the accuracy needed to constrain the physical properties of NEAs and their dynamical evolution will require larger samples, and homogeneous, unbiased reporting of the data, including accurate errors, for all objects observed, not just those with measured periods.", "title": ["Size matters: The rotation rates of small near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2013"}
{"abstract": "The Euphrosyne asteroid family is uniquely situated at high inclination in the outer Main Belt, bisected by the {\u03bd }<SUB>6</SUB> secular resonance. This large, low albedo family may thus be an important contributor to specific subpopulations of the near-Earth objects. We present simulations of the orbital evolution of Euphrosyne family members from the time of breakup to the present day, focusing on those members that move into near-Earth orbits. We find that family members typically evolve into a specific region of orbital element-space, with semimajor axes near \u223c 3 AU, high inclinations, very large eccentricities, and Tisserand parameters similar to Jupiter family comets. Filtering all known Near-Earth objects (NEOs) with our derived orbital element limits, we find that the population of candidate objects is significantly lower in albedo than the overall NEO population, although many of our candidates are also darker than the Euphrosyne family, and may have properties more similar to comet nuclei. Followup characterization of these candidates will enable us to compare them to known family properties, and confirm which ones originated with the breakup of (31) Euphrosyne.", "title": ["The Euphrosyne Family's Contribution to the Low Albedo Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2015"}
{"abstract": "Various natural effects gradually alter the surfaces of asteroids exposed to the space environment. These processes are collectively known as space weathering. The influence of space weathering on the observed spectra of C-complex asteroids remains uncertain. This has long hindered our understanding of their composition and evolution through ground-based telescope observations. Proximity observations of (162173) Ryugu by the telescopic Optical Navigation Camera (ONC-T) onboard Hayabusa2 and that of (101955) Bennu by MapCam onboard Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) found opposite spectral trends of space weathering; Ryugu darkened and reddened while Bennu brightened and blued. How the spectra of Ryugu and Bennu evolved relative to each other would place an important constraint for understanding their mutual relationship and differences in their origins and evolutions. In this study, we compared the space weathering trends on Ryugu and Bennu by applying the results of cross calibration between ONC-T and MapCam obtained in our companion paper. We show that the average Bennu surface is brighter by 18.0 \u00b1 1.5% at v band (550 nm) and bluer by 0.18 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcm<SUP>\u20111</SUP> (in the 480\u2013850 nm spectral slope) than Ryugu. The spectral slopes of surface materials are more uniform on Bennu than on Ryugu at spatial scales larger than \u223c1 m, but Bennu is more heterogeneous at scales below \u223c1 m. This suggests that lateral mixing of surface materials due to resurfacing processes may have been more efficient on Bennu. The reflectance\u2011spectral slope distributions of craters on Ryugu and Bennu appeared to follow two parallel trend lines with an offset before cross calibration, but they converged to a single straight trend without a bend after cross calibration. We show that the spectra of the freshest craters on Ryugu and Bennu are indistinguishable within the uncertainty of cross calibration. These results suggest that Ryugu and Bennu initially had similar spectra before space weathering and that they evolved in completely opposite directions along the same trend line, subsequently evolving into asteroids with different disk-averaged spectra. These findings further suggest that space weathering likely expanded the spectral slope variation of C-complex asteroids, implying that they may have formed from materials with more uniform spectral slopes.", "title": ["Comparison of optical spectra between asteroids Ryugu and Bennu: II.

{"abstract": "The rotational properties of ~10-m-scale asteroids are poorly understood with only a few measurements. Additionally, collisions or thermal recoil can spin their rotations to periods less than a few seconds obfuscating their study due to the observational cadence imposed by the long read-out times of charge-coupled device imagers. We present a method to measure the rotation periods of 10-m-scale asteroids using the target of opportunity capability of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and its MegaCam imager by intentionally streaking their detections in single exposures when they are at their brightest. Periodic changes in brightness as small as ~0.05 mag along the streak can be measured as short as a few seconds. Additionally, the streak photometry is taken in multiple g, r, and i filter exposures enabling the measurement of asteroid colours. The streak photometry method was tested on CFHT observations of three 10-m-scale asteroids, 2016 GE<SUB>1</SUB>, 2016 CG<SUB>18</SUB>, and 2016 EV<SUB>84</SUB>.

{"abstract": "We observed 191 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) using the Arecibo Observatory's S-band planetary radar system from December 2017 through December 2019. We present radar cross sections for 167 NEAs; circular-polarization ratios for 112 NEAs based on Doppler-echo-power spectra measurements; and radar albedos, constraints on size and spin periods, and surface-feature and shape evaluation for selected 37 NEAs, for which we obtained well-resolved delay-Doppler radar images with a range resolution of 75 m or finer. Figure 1 shows a representative sample of eight of these NEAs with the name or the designation and the vertical \u00d7 the horizontal image resolution displayed under each panel. Out of 33 NEAs with an estimated effective diameter of at least 200 m and a sufficient image quality to give clues of the shape, at least four (~12%) are binary asteroids, including one equal-mass binary asteroid, 2017 YE5, and at least ten (~30%) are contact binary asteroids. This is roughly twice the previous estimate of contact-binary NEAs with diameters of 200 m or more, which suggests that they could be more common than what has been previously thought. For five out of 112 asteroids with reliable measurements in both circular polarizations, we measured circular-polarization ratios greater than 1.0, which could indicate that they are E-type asteroids, while the mean with the one-sigma standard deviation was 0.37 \u00b1 0.23 for all 112 asteroids. Three of the five asteroids ((418900) 2009 BE2, 2019 QY1, and 2019 RC) had not been classified before, one (2015 JD1) had likely been misclassified, and one ((141593) 2002 HK12) was previously classified in the broader X-complex, but could be sub-classified as E-type also based on its visual geometric albedo that we we were able to refine using the radar images. Further, we find a mean opposite-sense circular-polarization radar albedo of 0.21 \u00b1 0.11 for 41 asteroids (0.19 \u00b1 0.06 for eleven S-complex asteroids). We identified two asteroids, 2011 WN15 and (505657) 2014 SR339, as possible metal-rich NEAs based on their unusually high radar albedos, and discuss possible evidence of water ice in 2017 YE5.

{"abstract": "Context. The Yarkovsky effect is a weak non-gravitational force but may significantly affect sub-kilometre-sized near-Earth asteroids. Yarkovsky-related drift may be detected, in principle, from astrometric or radar datasets of sufficient duration. To date, the asteroid Kamo'oalewa, the most stable of Earth's quasi-satellites, has an ~18 yr-long arc of ground-based optical astrometry. These data provide an opportunity to detect the Yarkovsky effect acting on the asteroid Kamo'oalewa. <BR /> Aims: We determined the Yarkovsky-related drift of asteroid Kamo'oalewa from ~18 yr of ground-based optical astrometry. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of the Yarkovsky effect on the orbital evolution of asteroid Kamo'oalewa based on this estimated value, and evaluated the potential improvements in the detection of non-gravitational accelerations (Yarkovsky effect and solar radiation pressure) for the asteroid Kamo'oalewa that could be provided by the future Chinese small-body exploration mission, Tianwen-2. <BR /> Methods: The Yarkovsky-related drift of asteroid Kamo'oalewa was detected from the orbital fitting of the astrometry measurements. We checked the Yarkovsky effect detection based on both the orbit fitting results and the physical mechanisms of the Yarkovsky effect. <BR /> Results: We report for the first time the detection of the Yarkovsky effect acting on asteroid Kamo'oalewa based on ~18 yr of ground-based optical astrometry data.

{"abstract": "YORP-induced fission events may form dynamically coherent pairs or even families of asteroids. The outcome of this process is well documented among members of the main asteroid belt, but not in the case of the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population because their paths randomize very efficiently in a short time-scale. Mean-motion resonances (MMRs) may stabilize the orbits of small bodies by making them avoid close encounters with planets.

The Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias (IAC), and in particular members of the Solar System Group, participate in the NEOROCKS project and currently are devoted to one specific task: to collect observational data, mainly in the visible and near-infrared wavelength regions, of NEAs that have been observed in the past using the Arecibo Planetary Radar. In this work we present preliminary results, focusing on those targets for which the signal-to-noise ratio is satisfactorily high.Observations. Our observations include spectroscopy, color photometry and lightcurves. They are performed using the facilities located at the Observatorios de Canarias (OOCC), including the El Teide Observatory in the island of Tenerife and the El Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the island of La Palma. Visible and near-infrared spectra are mainly obtained using the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC) and its visible (OSIRIS) and near-infrared (EMIR) spectrographs. We also use the ALFOSC spectrograph at the 2.5-m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). Visible color photometry is obtained using the MuSCAT2 instrument at the 1.5-m Telescopio Carlos S\u00e1nchez (TCS). The setup allows us to obtain simultaneous imaging in the g, r, i, and zs visible bands. Time-series photometry in the visible is obtained using several telescopes, including the 46-cm TAR2, 80-cm IAC-80, and 1-m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope (JKT). Results. Spectra in the visible and/or the near-infrared wavelengths, as well as color photometry in the visible, allow us to taxonomically classify the targets and to infer their composition. In the case of having no albedo measurements for any given object, we can also use the taxonomy to have an estimation of the albedo based on the spectral class, and therefore determine the size of the asteroid. Lightcurves allow us to both get the asteroid rotational period and, together with radar data, to obtain the shape and the spin axis orientation of the target. In this way, a full characterization can be obtained for every asteroid observed within this program. So far, we have obtained spectra/colors/lightcurves in the visible for more than 100 NEAs. In this work, we present our most updated results. Acknowledgements.

{"abstract": "We present an overview of the taxonomic classification of small asteroids using the 3.8 m United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT). Our project consists of a near-infrared (NIR) rapid-response spectrophotometry survey focused on characterizing small recently-discovered near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) using UKIRT's Wide-Field Camera (WFCAM). We have collected NIR photometry covering the wavelength range from 0.8 to 2.3 \u00b5m by implementing Z, J, H, and K band observations to determine the taxonomic classification of small NEAs. These filters cover characteristic fingerprints of the asteroid's absolute reflectance (i.e., olivine and pyroxene absorption features, reflectance slopes, and relative albedo). Furthermore, these broadband filters provide much greater sensitivity than spectroscopy, thus making possible the characterization of small asteroids (&lt;150 m) by determining their taxonomic classification. Thus, asteroid colors are directly correlated with the surface's composition and, by extension, its taxonomy. We have employed ground-truth spectra of asteroids for which Bus-DeMeo taxonomy is known and retrieved their corresponding colors by using a spectral convolution approach with the response function of each of the Z, J, H, and K filters. We used these colors to create a training sample that is used to provide probabilistic taxonomic classification using machine-learning tools. Our survey currently contains more than 350 small recently-discovered NEAs for which we will provide probabilistic taxonomic classification. Around 80% of our survey is populated by objects smaller than 170 m in diameter. In this size regime, our survey is about 2.8 times larger than the largest NEA spectroscopic survey (MITHNEOS).

We modeled the data and derived physical and dynamical properties of the binary systems. For (66391) 1999 KW4, we derived its mutual orbit's pole, semimajor axis and eccentricity that are in agreement with radar-derived values (Ostro et al., 2006. Science, 314, 1276-1280). However, we found that the data are inconsistent with a constant orbital period and we obtained unique solution with a quadratic drift of the mean anomaly of the satellite of -0.65 \u00b1 0.16 deg./yr<SUP>2</SUP> (all quoted uncertainties correspond to 3\u03c3). This means that the semimajor axis of the mutual orbit of the components of this binary system, determined a = 2.548 \u00b1 0.015 km by Ostro et al. (2006), increases in time with a mean rate of 1.2 \u00b1 0.3 cm/yr. <P />For (88710) 2001 SL9, we determined that the mutual orbit has a pole within 10\u00b0 of (L, B) = (302<SUP>\u2218</SUP>, -73<SUP>\u2218</SUP>) (ecliptic coordinates), and is close to circular (eccentricity &lt; 0.07). The data for this system are also inconsistent with a constant orbital period and we obtained two solutions for the quadratic drift of the mean anomaly: 2.8 \u00b1 0.2 and 5.2 \u00b1 0.2 deg./yr<SUP>2</SUP>, implying that the semimajor axis of the mutual orbit of the components (estimated a ~ 1.6 km) decreases in time with a mean rate of -2.8 \u00b1 0.2 or -5.1 \u00b1 0.2 cm/yr for the two solutions, respectively. <P />The expanding orbit of (66391) 1999 KW4 may be explained by mutual tides interplaying with binary YORP (BYORP) effect (McMahon and Scheeres, 2010a. Icarus 209, 494-509). However, a modeling of the BYORP drift using radar-derived shapes of the binary components predicted a much higher value of the orbital drift than the observed one. It suggests that either the radar-derived shape model of the secondary is inadequate for computing the BYORP effect, or the present theory of BYORP overestimates it. It is possible that the BYORP coefficient has instead an opposite sign than predicted; in that case, the system may be moving into an equilibrium between the BYORP and the tides. <P />In the case of (88710) 2001 SL9, the BYORP effect is the only known physical mechanism that can cause the inward drift of its mutual orbit. <P />Together with the binary (175706) 1996 FG3 which has a mean anomaly drift consistent with zero, implying a stable equilibrium between the BYORP effect and mutual body tides (Scheirich et al., 2015. Icarus 245, 56-63), we now have three distinct cases of well observed binary asteroid systems with their long-term dynamical models inferred.

{"abstract": "It is estimated that binary and triple asteroid systems represent approximately 15% of the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population. Multiple asteroid systems can help to understand the formation mechanism and evolution of small bodies in the solar system, which is especially important in Earth's vicinity as we monitor how NEA orbits evolve with time. Example of missions to binary asteroid systems are the ongoing NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) to the 65803 Didymos system, and the upcoming Janus mission, which will visit two binary NEAS, (175706) 1996 FG3 and (35107) 1991 VH. DART will be the first planetary defense mission demonstration ever performed, while Janus primary objectives are to identify and understand how binary asteroid systems form and evolve. Small body missions frequently select targets that can be observed with radar prior to the mission, including DART and Janus, as ground-based radar is a powerful tool for physical and dynamical characterization, helping to plan the mission. We will present the population of binary and triple NEAs observed with the Arecibo's planetary radar system. <P />Arecibo's S-band (2.38 GHz, 12.6 cm) planetary radar system helped to discover or confirm nearly 60 NEAs in multiple systems, 73% classified as potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs). The vast majority of these observed systems are in a binary configuration, only three were clearly triple systems in delay-Doppler images (3122 Florence, 1994 CC, and 2001 SN263). Although the most common configuration is to have a primary component much larger than the secondary one (or \"moonlet\"), radar images were able to reveal four equal-mass binaries (69230 Hermes, 2005 UP156, 1994 CJ1, and 2017 YE5), where the barycenter lies near the geometric center of the system. The detection of a satellite in radar images can help to extract important information about the system, for example, by knowing the separation distance between two components and mutual orbital period, it is possible to calculate the mass of the system and estimate density. In terms of orbit classification, at least 71% of the multiple asteroid systems observed at the Arecibo Observatory were part of the Apollo group, followed by 17% Amor, 8% Aten, and only one belonging to the Atira group (163693 Atira). In addition, approximately 50% of the radar-observed NEA systems have heliocentric orbit eccentricity e \u2265 0.5, with the binary NEA 5143 Heracles having the most eccentric orbit (e = 0.772).", "title": ["The Population of Binary and Triple Near-Earth Asteroids Observed with the Arecibo Planetary Radar System"], "year": "2022"}
{"abstract": "A group of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) that moved on similar orbits to each other and where the orbits could be classed as cometary were identified by searching the \"Near-Earth Objects Dynamic Site\" database. Six NEAs were identified, 2003HP2, 2006WX29, 2007VH189, 2007WT3, 2007WY3, and 2008UM1. The orbits were integrated back over one complete cycle in the variation of the argument of perihelion to identify times when their nodal distance was 1 AU. Theoretical meteoroids were assumed to have been released at these times on an orbit identical to those of the NEAs. The characteristics of a meteor shower that would be formed when these meteoroids hit the Earth's atmosphere were calculated. It was found that the showers produced from all six NEAs were identical and could be recognized as the nighttime \u03c7- and \u03b4-Scorpiids and the daytime \u03b2- and \u03c3-Librids, the latter two being named by us. It was also found that the orbital evolution of the Scorpiids was almost identical to the orbital evolution of the six NEAs. The similarity of the orbits, the nature of the orbit as cometary and the association of the Scorpiid meteoroid stream lead us to suggest that the origin of the whole complex was the fragmentation of some unknown comet several millennia ago.", "title": ["Near-Earth asteroids among the Scorpiids meteoroid complex"], "year": "2013"}

{"abstract": "Ongoing astrometric follow-up of near-Earth asteroids has yielded a variety of interesting results. In the limited space of a DPS abstract, three recently observed objects are worth mentioning.2008 HU4 is among the most accessible asteroids for a human space flight mission. We successfully recovered this object at a second opposition on 2016 April 26 despite the large ephemeris uncertainty. The small size of this asteroid makes it relatively easy to detect the departure from purely gravitational motion caused by solar radiation pressure, which can be used to estimate the density of the object. At the time of this writing, the object remains bright enough for additional observations, so we expect to improve on our five-sigma detection of a relatively low density (roughly similar to water, indicating a high porosity) between now and the DPS meeting.2016 HO3 is a newly-discovered co-orbital with the Earth. Our 2016 May 10-11 observations extended the observational arc by enough to permit backward extrapolation that led to prediscovery observations by Pan-STARRS in 2015, and then annually back to 2011, and ultimately to Sloan DSS observations in 2004. The 12-year arc is sufficient to examine the dynamical behavior of the object, which shows how it will remain in the vicinity of the Earth for decades, if not centuries. Our observations also revealed a rapid rotation (less than a half hour) with large brightness variation (in excess of 1 magnitude), which helps to explain why this object eluded discovery until this year.2011 YV62 is among the top 20 largest near-Earth asteroids with Earth impact solutions (in 2078 and 2080). At the time of this writing, the object is flagged as being \"lost\", but a re-examination of observations made in 2013 and 2015 finally yielded a successful recovery at a magnitude fainter than 24.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) pose a long-term hazard to the Earth and its inhabitants as a result of impacts such as the Tunguska event of 1908, and especially from still larger, although even less frequent events. An evaluation is presented of the ability of ground-based telescope systems to inventory the population of NEAs, as a function of telescope parameters, NEA size and albedo, and duration of the survey. The optimum strategy for surveying appears to be to cover the entire visible sky every month, rather than covering a smaller area of sky to a fainter threshold of detection. An optimally designed and operated system consisting of two or three 1 m telescopes should be able to achieve \u223c 75% completeness of survey down to a size of 1 km diameter, in 10 years of operation. To achieve a completeness &gt; 90% in the same time would require several telescopes of 2-3 m aperture. Achieving near-completeness down to the size of the smallest NEAs capable of causing significant ground damage (\u223c 70 m diameter) on a timescale of 10 years appears impractical with present technology, however because of the long timescale of events, even present or soon-to-start surveys are likely to discover the next Earth-impacting body before it hits.", "title": ["Evaluation of ground-based optical surveys for near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "1998"}
{"abstract": "Radar provides finer spatial resolution of near-Earth asteroids than any other type of ground-based observation. A powerful series of radio waves is transmitted toward the asteroid, and then some of the reflected echoes are received and recorded. These echoes can be decoded in round-trip light travel time (delay) and Doppler-shifted frequency to generate two-dimensional delay-Doppler images of the target. Given a set of delay-Doppler images from a range of times and viewing geometries, it is possible to determine the target's size, shape, and rotation state (e.g., Magri et al. 2007, Icarus 186). <P />We present shape models of three near-Earth asteroids that have been observed with the planetary radar systems at Arecibo Observatory and at NASA's Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex: 1981 Midas, 3200 Phaethon, and 2015 DP155.

We examine several processes that can generate the observed eccentricity and inclinations, including the Kozai and evection resonances, past mean-motion resonance crossings, and close encounters with terrestrial planets.

The EUROpean Near Earth Asteroid Research (EURONEAR) is a network which envisions to bring some European contributions into the general context traced by the Spaceguard Foundation which was carried out during the last 15 years mainly by the US with some modest European and amateur contributions. <BR /> Aims: The number of known near Earth asteroids (NEAs) and potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) has increased tremendously, mainly thanks to five major surveys all focused on the discovery of new bodies. But also other facilities are required to follow-up and improvement the orbital parameters and to study the physical properties of the known bodies. These goals are better achieved by a co-ordinated network such as EURONEAR. <BR /> Methods: Astrometry is mandatory in order to acquire the positional information necessary to define and improve orbits of NEAs and PHAs and to study their trajectories through the solar system, especially in the vicinity of Earth. Photometry is required to derive some physical information about NEAs and PHAs. In order to achieve these objectives, the main method of research of the EURONEAR is the follow-up programme of objects selected by a few criteria, carried out mostly at 1 m-class telescopes endowed with medium and large field cameras. <BR /> Results: 162 NEAs summing more than 1500 individual positions were observed for a total time of 55 nights in both visiting mode and regular runs using nine telescopes located in four countries. The observations were reduced promptly and reported to the Minor Planet Centre (MPC) which validated and included them in the MPC and NEODyS databases following the improvement of their orbital elements. For one binary NEA we acquired photometry and were able to determine its orbital and rotational periods. Complementary to the follow-up work, as many as 500 unknown moving objects consistent with new Main Belt asteroids and one possible NEA were discovered in the analyzed fields. <BR /> Conclusions: Our positions present 1 arcsec precision with an accuracy of 0.2-0.4 arcsec, sufficient for achieving our immediate main goals. The observations and data reduction were conducted by our network members, which included some students and amateurs supervised by professional astronomers. In most cases, we increased the observational arcs decreasing the uncertainties in the orbits, while in some cases the new positions allowed us to recover some bodies endangered to be lost, defining their orbits. <P />Based on observations acquired in Pic du Midi, Haute Provence, La Silla, Cerro Tololo, Las Campanas, Cerro Armazones, Bucharest Urseanu, and York University Observatories.Astrometric and photometric data are only available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/511/A40\">http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/511/A40</A>", "title": ["More than 160 near Earth asteroids observed in the EURONEAR network"], "year": "2010"}
{"abstract": "Several methods of asteroid deflection have been proposed in literature and the gravitational tractor is a new method using gravitational coupling for near-Earth object orbit modification. One weak point of gravitational tractor is that the deflection capability is limited by the mass and propellant of the spacecraft. To enhance the deflection capability, formation flying solar sail gravitational tractor is proposed and its deflection capability is compared with that of a single solar sail gravitational tractor. The results show that the orbital deflection can be greatly increased by increasing the number of the sails. The formation flying solar sail gravitational tractor requires several sails to evolve on a small displaced orbit above the asteroid. Therefore, a proper control should be applied to guarantee that the gravitational tractor is stable and free of collisions. Two control strategies are investigated in this paper: a loose formation flying realized by a simple controller with only thrust modulation and a tight formation realized by the sliding-mode controller and equilibrium shaping method.

{"abstract": "Spectral characterization of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) has revealed a continuum of space-weathered states for the surfaces of S-complex NEAs, with Q-class NEAs, an S-complex subclass, most closely matching the un-weathered surfaces of ordinary chondrite meteorites. Dynamical calculations of the orbital evolution of S-complex NEAs revealed that Q-class NEAs tend to have close encounters with terrestrial planets, suggesting that planetary tides may play a role in refreshing NEA surfaces. However, the exact physical mechanism(s) that drive resurfacing through tidal encounters and the encounter distance at which these mechanisms are effective, has remained unclear. Through the lens of the upcoming (99942) Apophis encounter with Earth in 2029, we investigate the potential for surface mobilization through tidally-driven seismic shaking over short-timescales during encounter and subsequent surface slope evolution over longer-timescales driven by tumbling. We perform multi-scale numerical modeling and find that the 2029 encounter will induce short-term tidally-driven discrete seismic events that lead to high-frequency (&gt;0.1 Hz) surface accelerations that reach magnitudes similar to Apophis' gravity, and that may be detectable by modern seismometers. It is still unclear if the shaking we model translates to widespread particle mobilization and/or lofting. We also find there will be a significant change in Apophis' tumbling spin state that could lead to longer-term surface refreshing in response to tumbling-induced surface slope changes. We propose that through these mechanisms, space-weathered S-class asteroid surfaces may become refreshed through the exposure of unweathered underlying material. These results will be tested by the future exploration of Apophis by NASA's OSIRIS-APEX.", "title": ["Shaking and Tumbling: Short- and Long-Timescale Mechanisms for Resurfacing of Near-Earth Asteroid Surfaces from Planetary Tides and Predictions for the 2029 Earth Encounter by (99942) Apophis"], "year": "2024"}
{"abstract": "A previous theory by the authors for detailed modeling of the binary YORP effect is reviewed and expanded to accommodate doubly-synchronous binary systems, as well as a method for non-dimensionalizing the coefficients for application to binary systems where a shape model to compute its own coefficients is not available. The theory is also expanded to account for the effects of primary J<SUB>2</SUB> and the Sun's 3rd body perturbation on the secular orbit evolution. The newly expanded theory is applied to the binary near-Earth Asteroid 1999 KW4, for which a detailed shape model is available. The result of simulation of the secular evolutionary equations shows that the KW4 orbit will be double in size in approximately 22,000 years, and will reach the Hill radius in approximately 54,000 years. The simulation also shows that the eccentricity will alternate growing and shrinking in magnitude, depending on the location of the solar node in the body-fixed frame. Therefore the eccentricity is not fixed to evolve in the opposite sign as the semi-major axis unless the circulation of the node (with a period of 500 years) is averaged out as well. The current orbit expansion rate for KW4 of 7 cm per year is shown to be detectable with observations of the mean anomaly which grows quadratically in time with an expanding orbit. Finally, the KW4 results are scaled for application to a number of other binary systems for which detailed shape models are not available.

{"abstract": "The distribution and physical nature of km-sized asteroids have been, until recently, mysteries. Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) afford us the best opportunity to examine this population, due to their tendency to be bright during close approaches to the Earth. We present here the results of our inquiries into the rotation states, orbital distribution, and compositions of these small bodies. First, our study of the rotation states of very small asteroids confirms that all well-studied asteroids less than about 200 m in diameter rotate extremely rapidly. The rotation periods of these objects are fast enough that they are rotating under tension, and must be single monolithic bodies, instead of gravitationally accreted \"rubble\" piles. Due to the extraordinarily high specific rotation energies of these objects, we hypothesize that they are not the products of typical catastrophic disruptions, but are instead derived from impacts into pre-existing rubble piles. Second, our low solar elongation search program has yielded 8 NEA discoveries, at elongations ranging from 51\u00b0 to 84\u00b0. From our debiased population model, we conclude that there are \u223c700 NEAs larger than 1 km, which is roughly consistent with other measurements. Furthermore, the low solar elongation techniques demonstrated here are a valuable complement to wide-field opposition surveys, since they enable the discovery of NEAs that are otherwise unobservable. Finally, the results of our spectrophotometric survey of approximately 80 NEAs show that more than 75% of asteroids in the 1 km size range have the spectroscopic signature of coarse-grained silicates. The small NEAs seem to be the repository of the ordinary chondrite meteorites, which are the most common meteorite type. Approximately 35% of our sample NEAs are reasonable analogs for this meteorite class, and for the Q-type asteroid (1862) Apollo. Furthermore, the overall distribution of the small asteroids in color space matches the distribution of known meteorite types. Based on current collisional age models for asteroids, we conclude that the spectral degeneracy between chondritic meteorites, their asteroid analogs, and classical S-type asteroids is not due to a time-dependent surface alteration processes.", "title": ["A compositional and dynamical survey of the near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2001"}

{"abstract": "The density of near earth asteroids is a fundamental property which can illuminate the structure of the asteroid, provide clues about it\u2019s collisional history and is key in assessing the hazard of an impact of an NEA with Earth. A low density can be indicative of a rubble pile structure whereas a higher density can imply a monolith and/or a higher metal content. Unfortunately, measuring the density of asteroids is extremely difficult, has only been attempted for a tiny fraction of NEAs and usually results in measurements with large uncertainties. In the absence of density measurements for a specific object, understanding the range and distribution of likely densities can allow for probabilistic assessments of the population and facilitate estimates of the range of reasonable masses for a specific object. We have developed a candidate macroporosity distribution for near earth asteroids based on measurements of meteorite densities and asteroid densities. The macroporosity of an asteroid can be used to aid extrapolation from meteorite physical properties to asteroid physical properties. In addition, we discuss estimating an asteroid density distribution from the macroporosity distribution.", "title": ["Density and Macroporosity Distribution of Near Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2017"}

{"abstract": "The authors explore the possibility that near-earth, rubble pile asteroids might be used as habitats for human settlement by increasing their rotation to produce spin gravity. Using previously published scaling by Maindl et al. and studies of asteroid populations, it is shown that there is no class of hollowed body that would survive the spin-up process on its own without additional reinforcement. Large solid-rock asteroids (diameter $D &gt; 10$ km) would not have the tensile strength to withstand the required rotation rates and would fracture and break apart. Smaller asteroids, being 'rubble piles', have little tensile strength and would quickly disperse. The possibility of containing the asteroid mass using higher-strength materials like carbon nanofiber is instead considered. It is found that a moderate tensile strength container can maintain the integrity of a large spinning cylinder composed of dispersed asteroid regolith. The research extends the range of possible asteroid habitat candidates, since it may become feasible to construct habitats from the more numerous smaller bodies, including NEAs (Near Earth Asteroids). The required tensile strength of the container material scales with habitat radius and thickness and is $\\sim200$ MPa for a starting asteroid body of radius 300m that is spun up to provide 0.3 $g_\\oplus$ while increasing its radius to 3 km and maintaining a rubble and regolith shield thickness of 2m to protect against cosmic rays.

{"abstract": "We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of using a satellite-based sensor with visual and infrared focal plane arrays to search for that subclass of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) with orbits largely interior to the Earth's orbit. A space-based visual-infrared system could detect approximately 97% of the Atens and 64% of the IEOs (the, as yet hypothetical, objects with orbits entirely Interior to Earth's Orbit) with diameters greater than 1 km in a 5-year mission and obtain orbits, albedos and diameters for all of them; the respective percentages with diameters greater than 500 m are 90% and 60%. Incidental to the search for Atens and IEOs, we found that 70% of all Earth-Crossing Asteroids (ECAs) with diameters greater than 1 km, and 50% of those with diameters greater than 500 m, would also be detected. These are the results of a feasibility study; optimizing the concept presented would result in greater levels of completion. The cost of such a space-based system is estimated to be within a factor of two of the cost of a ground-based system capable of about 21st magnitude, which would provide only orbits and absolute magnitudes and require decades to reach these completeness levels. In addition to obtaining albedos and diameters for the asteroids discovered in the space-based survey, a space-based visual-infrared system would obtain the same information on virtually all NEOs of interest. A combined space-based and ground-based survey would be highly synergistic in that each can concentrate on what it does best and each complements the strengths of the other. The ground-based system would discover the majority of Amors and Apollos and provide long-term follow-up on all the NEOs discovered in both surveys. The space-based system would discover the majority of Atens and IEOs and provide albedos and diameters on all the NEOs discovered in both surveys and most previously discovered NEOs as well. Thus, an integrated ground- and space-based system could accomplish the Spaceguard goal in less time than the ground-based system alone.

{"abstract": "Besides new observations, mining old photographic plates and CCD image archives represents an opportunity to recover and secure newly discovered asteroids, also to improve the orbits of Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs), Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) and Virtual Impactors (VIs). These are the main research aims of the EURONEAR network. As stated by the IAU, the vast collection of image archives stored worldwide is still insufficiently explored, and could be mined for known NEAs and other asteroids appearing occasionally in their fields. This data mining could be eased using a server to search and classify findings based on the asteroid class and the discovery date as ``precoveries'' or ``recoveries''. We built PRECOVERY, a public facility which uses the Virtual Observatory SkyBoT webservice of IMCCE to search for all known Solar System objects in a given observation. To datamine an entire archive, PRECOVERY requires the observing log in a standard format and outputs a database listing the sorted encounters of NEAs, PHAs, numbered and un-numbered asteroids classified as precoveries or recoveries based on the daily updated IAU MPC database. As a first application, we considered an archive including about 13 000 photographic plates exposed between 1930 and 2005 at the Astronomical Observatory in Bucharest, Romania. Firstly, we updated the database, homogenizing dates and pointings to a common format using the JD dating system and J2000 epoch. All the asteroids observed in planned mode were recovered, proving the accuracy of PRECOVERY. Despite the large field of the plates imaging mostly 2.27\u00b0 \u00d7 2.27\u00b0 fields, no NEA or PHA could be encountered occasionally in the archive due to the small aperture of the 0.38 m refractor insufficiently to detect objects fainter than {V \u223c 15}.

{"abstract": "<BR /> Aims: We developed a six-part collisional evolution model of the main asteroid belt (MB) and used it to study the contribution of the different regions of the MB to the near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). <BR /> Methods: We built a statistical code called ACDC that simulates the collisional evolution of the MB split into six regions (namely Inner, Middle, Pristine, Outer, Cybele and High-Inclination belts) according to the positions of the major resonances present there (\u03bd<SUB>6</SUB>, 3:1J, 5:2J, 7:3J and 2:1J). We consider the Yarkovsky effect and the mentioned resonances as the main mechanism that removes asteroids from the different regions of the MB and delivers them to the NEA region. We calculated the evolution of the NEAs coming from the different source regions by considering the bodies delivered by the resonances and mean dynamical timescales in the NEA population. <BR /> Results: Our model is in agreement with the major observational constraints associated with the MB, such as the size distributions of the different regions of the MB and the number of large asteroid families. It is also able to reproduce the observed NEAs with H &lt; 16 and agrees with recent estimations for H &lt; 20, but deviates for smaller sizes. We find that most sources make a significant contribution to the NEAs; however the Inner and Middle belts stand out as the most important source of NEAs followed by the Outer belt. The contributions of the Pristine and Cybele regions are minor. The High-Inclination belt is the source of only a fraction of the actual observed NEAs with high inclination, as there are dynamical processes in that region that enable asteroids to increase and decrease their inclinations.", "title": ["New multi-part collisional model of the main belt: the contribution to near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2020"}

{"abstract": "The near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon is regarded as the parent body of the Geminid meteor stream. It is also an active asteroid with a very blue spectrum which is similar to that of the members of the Pallas family. For obtaining this asteroid's surface property in more detail, we conducted a series of multicolor photometry of this asteroid over a wide range of solar phase angle during its close approach to the Earth in the end of 2017. Our observations confirmed that Phaethon is a C-complex asteroid as previous studies have claimed. We also obtained the phase curve for this asteroid in solar phase angle of 22.67 \u223c 114.48\u00b0. From this result, we estimate that the absolute magnitude (H) of this asteroid is 14.450 \u00b1 0.017 mag, and its phase slope is (\u03b2) \u223c0.0422 \u00b1 0.0005.

{"abstract": "Context. The JAXA Hayabusa2 mission will perform the first ever sample return from a primitive asteroid. The target near-Earth asteroid (162173) Ryugu will be reached in mid-2018 and its samples will be returned to the Earth by the end of 2020. <BR /> Aims: We want to improve the current knowledge of the compositional and rotational properties of Ryugu, which are still presenting some uncertainties that might affect the mission operations and scientific return. <BR /> Methods: We acquired high-quality photometric time-series data with the FORS2 instrument at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory (ESO-VLT, Chile). We also acquired four FORS2 visible spectra and three X-shooter spectra in the 0.35-2.15 \u03bcm range, at different rotational phases. <BR /> Results: We obtained the currently highest-quality visual light-curve of Ryugu. A best solution of ~7.63 h is found for the rotational period, while a short-period solution (i.e., P \u2248 3.8 h) is ruled out by the clearly non-symmetric light-curve. The obtained spectra are generally similar and featureless, but present a drop-off of the reflectance at &lt;0.45 \u03bcm, suggesting the presence of aqueously altered minerals on Ryugu.

{"abstract": "The population of near-Earth objects comprises active comets and asteroids, covering a wide range of dynamical parameters and physical properties. Dormant (or extinct) comets, masquerading as asteroids, have long been suspected of supplementing the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population. We present a search for asteroidal objects of cometary origin based on dynamical and physical considerations. Our study is based on albedos derived within the ExploreNEOs program and is extended by adding data from NEOWISE and the Akari asteroid catalog. We use a statistical approach to identify asteroids on orbits that resemble those of short-period near-Earth comets using the Tisserand parameter with respect to Jupiter, the aphelion distance, and the minimum orbital intersection distance with respect to Jupiter. We identify a total of 23 near-Earth asteroids from our sample that are likely to be dormant short-period near-Earth comets and, based on a de-biasing procedure applied to the cryogenic NEOWISE survey, estimate both magnitude-limited and size-limited fractions of the NEA population that are dormant short-period comets. We find that 0.3-3.3% of the NEA population with H &lt;= 21, and 9(+2/-5)% of the population with diameters d &gt;= 1 km, are dormant short-period near-Earth comets. We also present an observation program that utilizes the 1.8m Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT) on Mt. Graham, AZ, to identify dormant comet candidates and search for activity in these objects. Our targets are NEAs on comet-like orbits, based on the dynamical criteria derived in the above study, that are accessible with the VATT (V &lt;= 22). We identify dormant comets based on their optical spectral slope, represented by V-R color measurements, as albedo measurements for most of these objects are not available. For each target we measure and monitor its V magnitude in order to reveal activity outbreaks. We also search for extended emission around our targets using deep imaging and a point-spread-function subtraction technique that allows us to obtain an upper limit on the dust production rate in each target. We present preliminary results from this program.

{"abstract": "The motion of a near Earth Asteroids (NEA) will often result in a streaked image on a typical 30sec CCD exposure. The fact that photons from the asteroid are spread over many pixels reduces both the sensitivity of the camera as well as astrometric accuracy of the measurement. Instead of taking a 30sec exposure, synthetic tracking takes multiple short 0.5s) images where the NEA image is not streaked. A shift and add algorithm is used to generate an image of the NEA as if the telescope were tracking the moving object. This type of algorithm is sometimes called a multi-hypothesis velocity matched filter. While the improvement in sensitivity for detecting moving objects has been explored, it turns out there is an equally significant improvement in astrometric accuracy, when we looked at data from a high frame rate camera on the Palomar 5m telescope. As new NEO search telescopes/cameras become operational, the number of discoveries will increase beyond the ~1000/year. Most of these objects especially &lt; 100m dia, will be lost almost immediately after discovery. An improvement in optical astrometry of 1 20 could enable improved orbits to where they could be found if they were to pass near the Earth by 4-6 years in the future.

{"abstract": "Meteoroids, asteroids, and comets have been permanently interacting with Earthduring its existence. When an object, such as a comet or an asteroid, revolve around the Sun it may leave fragments of matter behind it and if this object is in Earth's proximity, those fragments are gathered by the planet gravity. The study of these objects and the link between them can help in the understanding of the formation and evolution conditions of the Solar System, the conditions of developing the life on Earth, the chaotic processes in the Solar System, Earth security and maybe, in future, space industry.All objects within the Solar System are characterized by their orbits andthe meteoroid streams have similar orbits with the objects that produce them. For that reason the most common method of parent body identification is based onorbits similarities, also known as discrimination criteria or D-Criteria. In my work I used three D-Criteria metrics for parent body association. I set a threshold for each metric by using a new threshold selection method. Moreover, I investigated the associated objects orbital stability, in the Lyapunov time sense and their physical properties.Due to the similarities between meteoroid streams and their parent bodies,it is required for the associations to belong to Near Earth Asteroids population. But for this population is difficult to obtain data. The favorable geometry for these objects observations occurs five times per century. For this reason was created an observational program, that aims to obtain physical data for the associated objects that do not have physical data.My results consist from 296 asteroids that were associated with 28 meteorshowers, from which 73 asteroids satisfied all the criteria used. From the dynamical perspective, my sample contains 82% of Apollo asteroids and 7% are classified as potential hazardous, 15.3% are on cometary orbits and 84.3% are on asteroidal orbits. From the physical data perspective, I found two asteroids that are fast-rotators, therefore they can not generate meteors. On the other hand, I also found associated one binary asteroid and one tumbling asteroid, objects with a high probability of being parent bodies.I also managed to find similarities between 5 meteorites and 5 associatedasteroids with physical data and I obtained observational data for three associated asteroids.", "title": ["Near Earth Asteroids associated with meteor showers"], "year": "2018"}
{"abstract": "We report Goldstone radar observations of near-Earth asteroid (NEA) 3122 Florence obtained in2017. We observed Florence on 14 days between August 29-September 13, dates that straddledthe asteroid's closest approach within 0.047 au. With an estimated diameter of about 4.4 km(Mainzer et al. 2011), Florence is among the largest near-Earth asteroids. The radar datareveal that Florence is a triple system that consists of a large primary body and two smallmoons that revolve around it.The observations yielded an extensive set of delay-Doppler images achieving range resolutionsas fine as 75 m/pixel that placed hundreds of pixels on the primary asteroid. At least onelarge crater, several hundred meters in diameter, is visible in images obtained on Sep. 1, theday of the closest approach. Tracking of features visible in the images confirms the 2.36 hrotation period estimated from lightcurves by Wisniewski et al. (1997). The images suggestthe primary has equatorial and polar dimensions of 4.6 and 4.1 km and a low elongation. Theshape is sloped in both hemispheres and resembles the primary of the 1999 KW4 binary systemreported by Ostro et al. (2006). The dimensions inferred from the radar images are consistentwith those estimated from thermal infrared observations reported by Mainzer et al. (2011).Florence is only the third known triple system in the near-Earth asteroid population (after 2001SN263 and 1994 CC) and it is by far the largest. Preliminary estimates for the diameters ofthe satellites are \u223c0.2 and 0.3 km, and they orbit the primary with periods of about 7 and 22hours. The inner moon of Florence has the most rapid orbital period among all satellites of theknown binary and triple systems in both NEA and main belt populations. We observed tworadar eclipses of the inner moon on Aug. 31 and Sep. 1. We used the measurements of delay-Doppler positions of the satellites to estimate the orbital parameters, mass, and bulk densityof the system. Due to the three-body nature of the system, we integrated the full equations ofmotion of the system to fit the radar astrometry estimated from Goldstone and Arecibo images.The orbital fit suggests that the pole of the primary is within 10 deg of the ecliptic longitudeand latitude of (78 deg, -85 deg), although we cannot exclude a prograde pole 180 degrees fromthis point. We obtain a system mass of (7.9 \u00b1 0.2)\u00d710^{13} kg and a J2 value to 0.092 \u00b1 0.013,where J2 is the second degree zonal harmonic of the gravity field. If we adopt an equivalentdiameter of 4.2 km for the primary, then the system mass implies a bulk density of 2 g/cm ^{3},which, for plausible S-class meteorite analogues, is consistent with a porosity of at least a fewtens of percent. The J2 value is consistent with the theoretical value calculated for a uniformdensity oblate object. The radar data were obtained as the asteroid moved 90 degrees on thesky, covered a wide range of subradar latitudes, and are ideal for estimation of a detailed 3-Dshape model of the primary.", "title": ["Goldstone radar observations of triple near-Earth asteroid 3122 Florence"], "year": "2018"}

{"abstract": "Although there is some success in finding Near Earth asteroids from ground-based telescopes, there is a marked advantage in performing the search from space. The ability to search at closer elongations from the sun and being able to observe continuously, allowing quick revisits of new asteroids, are some of the unique benefits of a space platform. The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) together with Defense Research and Development Canada (DRDC) are planning a micro-satellite platform with a 15 cm telescope dedicated for near space surveillance. The NEOSSat (Near Earth Object Surveillance) spacecraft is expected to be able to detect 20 v magnitude objects with a 100 sec exposure, with a 0.85 deg FOV, on a 1024x1024 CCD, and sub arcsec pointing stability. For detection of NEO small bodies, it will be able to search an area from 45 degrees solar elongation and approximately 40 degrees north to south degrees in elevation. The observation strategy will be optimized to find as many asteroids as possible, based on recent models of asteroid population. Ground based telescopes will also be used to complement follow-ups for orbit determination when possible.

{"title": ["Photometry of super fast rotating, near-Earth asteroid 2015 KW120"], "year": "2020", "abstract": "1. IntroductionStudying Very Small Asteroids (VSAs, effective diameter &lt;150 m) is important for understanding the structure and evolution of asteroids and some non-gravitational effects (YORP and Yarkovsky effects). VSAs originate from collisions or rotational disintegration of larger bodies, which are the so-called rubble pile asteroids. Because VSAs are monoliths, they can have shorter rotation periods than the spin barier (P&lt;2.2 h), which limits the rotation rates of rubble piles.Due to their small sizes VSAs are usually observed as Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), during their close approaches to Earth. At that time they pose an observational challenge due to fast movement in te sky.2015 KW120 is NEA belong to Apollo group. It was discovered on 24 May 2015 by Catalina Sky Survey (MPEC 2015-K99). At the night of our observations (29 May), it was closest to the Earth at 1.1 Earth-Moon distance and its magnitude (according to the MPC) was V=15.6.2. Observations and data reductionObservations were performed with a 0.7-m robotic RBT/PST2 telescope at Winer Observatory in Arizona, with the Andor iXon3 888 CCD camera, which has a field of view (FoV) 10' x 10'. We used a broadband filter L (\"luminosity\", transmission 370-700 nm), which can be thought of as a sum of the g and r SDSS bands. Each CCD frame was exposed for 15 seconds. Data were calibrated for bias and flat field.As the proper motion of 2015 KW120 was very high (370 arcsec/min), the telescope followed the asteroid to keep it in the FoV and to maximize the S/N. In this way, the image of the asteroid remained round on the CCD frame, and the images of the stars were trailed (Fig. 1). Instrumental magnitude measurements for the asteroid were made using the standard aperture photometry method (Fig. 2).Usually the changes of the atmosphere transparency affect a lightcurve. This can be prevented by using comparison stars. But in our case, with a fast-moving asteroid, we came across two issues:1) Long trails of stars in the CCD frame, for which the appropriate aperture shape should be used (an ellipse or better a pill[4]). We could not do automatic photometry of such fast changing position trails using Starlink package[1]. (The aperture position would have to be manually specified.)2) At this speed, potential comparison stars leave the FoV very quickly. Our estimates assume that we would need about 90 stars to cover the entire observation.Both reasons make the differential photometry in this case very laborious. Fortunately, the night was photometric and the collected data are of good quality, allowing for accurate determination of the rotation period. 3. Rotation periodWe determined the rotation period by folding curves with the least squares fit of the Fourier series. The algorithm of our program was described in [5].We obtained 4 probable solutions for the period: P1, P2, P3 and P4 (see Fig. 3). The most likely is P2=0.1358 h (see solution P2 in Fig 3 and composite curve for P2 solution in Fig 4.). The two maxima and two minima of the brightness of this solution are typical for the commonly accepted triaxial ellipsoid approximation of the shape of most asteroids. We also analyzed the remaining 3 solutions in terms of the probability of a curve dominated by a given Fourier harmonic at a given peak-to-peak amplitude and the solar phase angle. For this, we used tables from [2]. As observations were made at the phase angle of 64-74\u00b0 and the amplitude is about 1.35 mag (measured from the Fourier fit curve), other solutions are very unlikely. Fig. 1. A fragment of an example CCD frame, showing the trailed stars. The 2015 KW120 asteroid image is marked with a yellow aperture.Fig. 2. Lightcurve of 2015 KW120 Fig. 3. Search period results showing a range of trial periods and the corresponding \u03c72 per degree of freedom. There are four possible solutions, marked by P1,P2,P3 and P4 Fig. 4. Composite lightcurve of 2015 KW120 for the most probable rotation period P2. 4. The asteroid location in the period-diameter plotThe effective diameter can be determined from a standard equation given in [3]:Deff=1329\u00d710(-H/5)\u00d7pV(-1/2) where: pV means the geometric albedo of the asteroid surface in the V band and H means absolute magnitude. The value of H=26 mag was taken from the Minor Planet Center. The albedo is not known for this asteroid, so we assumed pV=0.2 (this value is used in the Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB) [6] for NEAs). Hence, we received D=19 m. The asteroid location in the PvsDeff plot is marked with a blue square in Figure 5. The asteroid definitely exceeds the spin barrier and is small in size, hence we conclude that it has a monolithic structure.References5. SummaryWe observed 2015 KW120 asteroid, determined the rotation period P=0.1358\u00b10.0001 h (8.147\u00b10.006 min), and the amplitude peak-to-peak A=1.35 mag. Based on the location of the asteroid on the logP-logDeff chart, we conclude that the asteroid is a rapidly rotating monolith. In the near future, we are going to publish the results for other VSAs and also continue to observe objects of this type. References[1] Butkiewicz-B\u0105k et al.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth Asteroid (35107) 1991 VH was discovered to be a binary in March 1997, based on its light-curve (IAUC 6607). It made a very close approach to the Earth in August 2008 at a distance of 0.045 AU. We used this opportunity to secure an extensive radar data set with the Arecibo S-band (2380 MHz, 13 cm wavelength) planetary radar system, including range-Doppler images with spatial resolution as fine as 15 m. The images (spanning 14 days) reveal that the primary is roughly spheroidal with a radius of 650 m. The range extent of the secondary in these images varies from less than 100 m to more than 200 m indicating that it is highly elongated. The radar data provide an excellent determination of the mutual orbit: The orbital period is 32 hours, the eccentricity is 0.05, and the total system mass is 1.5e12 kg. Numerical simulations of the spin of the elongated secondary in this eccentric mutual orbit reveal a large region of chaos in the phase space, similar to that observed in Saturn\u2019s moon Hyperion (Wisdom, Peale, Mignard 1984). The chaotic region surrounds the 1:2, 1:1, 3:2 and 2:1 spin-orbit resonances, but allows for islands of stability around the 1:2 and 1:1 spin-orbit states. The secondary\u2019s echo bandwidths indicate that its spin rate indeed lies within or very close to this chaotic region. To date no acceptable fit to the sequence of secondary images has been found under the assumption of synchronous spin. Saturn\u2019s moon Hyperion is the only solar system object known so far to have a chaotic spin state (Wisdom, Peale, Mignard 1984).", "title": ["Dynamics of Binary Near-Earth Asteroid System (35107) 1991 VH"], "year": "2012"}

Four of the asteroids showed indications of non-principal axis rotation (NPAR), or tumbling, (9400) 1994 TW1, (86666) 2000 FL10, (154807) 2004 PP97, and (206378) 2003 RB, but there were insufficient data for full analysis. On the other hand, 2015 JY1 is a confirmed tumbler with a dominate period of 6.442 h and a likely second period of 11.42 h. Evidence of the satellite for the known binary system (385186) 1994 AW1 was found. The estimated size ratio of Ds/Dp &gt;= 0.25 is in good agreement with earlier results.

{"abstract": "While the orbits of many known near-Earth objects (NEOs) may cross that of Earth, very few NEOs actually approach near to Earth itself. In fact, the majority of NEOs spend most of their orbital periods in the asteroid belt beyond Mars. However, there is a subset of NEOs on orbits which allow for repeated close-encounters with Earth. These objects are locked in a co-orbital resonance with Earth, orbiting the sun in exactly one year. This unusual one-to-one resonance causes the NEOs to appear to be orbiting Earth and gives them their name; quasi-satellites.Despite their close proximity to Earth, only recently have the first quasi-satellites of Earth been detected. These are the asteroids 2003 YN107, 2004 GU9, and 2006 FV35. We carried out N-body computer simulations of these asteroids as well as a larger theoretical population. We demonstrate that quasi-satellite asteroids always remain exceptionally close to Earth, typically just 20-60 times farther than the moon, and undergo two close-encounters with Earth each year. Furthermore, quasi-satellites that eventually escape the resonance can have extremely deep low-velocity close-encounters with Earth as they leave the resonance, some coming well inside the orbit of the moon.When weak drag forces are included in the simulations quasi-satellite objects evolve onto more Earth-like orbits and spiral closer and closer to Earth. This dramatically reduces the relative velocity and distance of closest approach between Earth and the quasi-satellite object. Under the influence of weak drag quasi-satellites objects can develop effective encounter velocities of just a few hundred meters per second, often much less. These low encounter velocities lead to a strong enhancement in Earth\u2019s gravitationally enhanced impact cross-section compared to close-encounters of non-resonant objects with similar initial orbital elements.This research is supported by NASA grant NNX14AN23G.", "title": ["The Nearest of the Near Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2014"}
{"abstract": "For several decades, the main asteroid belt has been known to be the primary source for near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and meteorite-dropping fireballs. The qualitative understanding of the evolution of main-belt asteroids to NEAs has allowed the construction of quantitative evolutionary population models for NEAs that describe their source regions (and/or escape routes) in the asteroid belt as well as debiased distributions of NEA orbits, absolute magnitudes, and geometric albedos. One of the primary goals with such evolutionary models has long been to link the compositional data on NEAs and meteorite falls back to the asteroid belt. Ultimately, the goal is to set constraints on the compositional distribution in the primordial asteroid belt. I will first describe the latest one of the evolutionary models of the NEO population (Granvik et al. 2018, Icarus 312, 181) and highlight the main improvements compared to the previous generation of models. In particular, I will explain how the modeling of the available observational data has met and surpassed our initial goals and is starting to reveal geophysical information about asteroids. I will then present selected results that utilize the new model such as establishing the source regions for meteorite falls and NEAs, and correlating that information with their compositions and other physical data. The debiased orbit and absolute-magnitude distributions also allow us to assess the long-term impact rate onto terrestrial planets and to compare the predicted impact rates with the observed crater record. Finally, I will discuss future improvements to the models as well as the relevant observational data that is expected to become available within the next decade.", "title": ["Source regions of meteorites and near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2020"}
{"abstract": "The near-Earth asteroid (469219) Kamo`oalewa is one of a handful of known quasi-satellites of Earth. Numerical solutions show that on timescales of decades or centuries, it transitions between quasi-satellite and horseshoe orbital states, maintaining this behavior for the order of megayears. Little is known about its physical properties and origins. Considering its Earth-like orbit, we explore the hypothesis that it might have originated in the Earth-Moon system as a fragment of the Moon, as debris from a meteoroidal impact with the Moon's surface. We carry out numerical simulations of test particles ejected from the Moon surface at different locations and with a range of ejection velocities. The set of initial conditions has been constrained to look for trajectories compatible with Kamo`oalewa's dynamical behavior, exploring the possible lunar origin of this asteroid. These simulations are performed using the REBOUND software package. Besides potentially identifying a plausible origin for Kamo`oalewa or other dynamically similar near-Earth objects, these simulations also enable exploration of the rich dynamics of particles around the Earth-Moon system.", "title": ["Near-Earth Asteroid Kamo`oalewa as Lunar Ejecta"], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) are excellent laboratories for processes that affect the surfaces of airless bodies. Most NEAs were not expected to contain OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O on their surfaces because they formed in the anhydrous regions of the Solar System and their surface temperatures are high enough to remove these volatiles. However, a 3-\u03bcm feature typically indicative of OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O was identified on other seemingly dry bodies in the inner Solar System, such as the Moon and Vesta, and more recently on the NEAs Eros and Ganymed. Six other NEAs have been identified that exhibit or potentially exhibit a 3-\u03bcm feature, but Ganymed and Eros have been observed the most. Possible sources for OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O on these bodies include carbonaceous chondrite impacts or interactions with protons implanted by solar wind. <P />We observed Eros and Ganymed multiple times using SpeX on NASA's IRTF.

We have made 8 observations of Eros and 6 observations of Ganymed as part of this ongoing project. Including observations made by Rivkin et al.

Time from perihelion has a loose correlation with band depth, but no other determining factors have been identified, though studies are ongoing.

We prove that this discrepancy was caused by a poor astrometric treatment and an incomplete dynamical model, which did not account for nongravitational perturbations. To improve the astrometric treatment, we remove known star catalog biases, apply suitable weights to the observations, and use an aggressive outlier rejection scheme. The main issue related to the dynamical model is having not accounted for the Yarkovsky effect. Including the Yarkovsky perturbation in the model makes the orbital prediction and the radar measurements statistically consistent by both reducing the offset and increasing the prediction uncertainty to a more realistic level.

In a previous study [2], we constrained this model with spectra (0.7- 5.1 \u03bcm) obtained at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) from August 2019-September 2019 along with delay-Doppler images and continuous wave (CW) spectra from Arecibo Observatory.

{"abstract": "This article describes a citizen-science project conducted by the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) to improve the orbits of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) using data from astronomical archives. The list of NEAs maintained at the Minor Planet Center (MPC) is checked daily to identify new objects or changes in the orbital parameters of already catalogued objects. Using NEODyS we compute the position and magnitude of these objects at the observing epochs of the 938 046 images comprising the Eigth Data Release of the Sloan Digitised Sky Survey (SDSS). If the object lies within the image boundaries and the magnitude is brighter than the limiting magnitude, then the associated image is visually inspected by the project's collaborators ({the citizens}) to confirm or discard the presence of the NEA. If confirmed, accurate coordinates and, sometimes, magnitudes are submitted to the MPC. Using this methodology, 3226 registered users have made during the first fifteen months of the project more than 167 000 measurements which have improved the orbital elements of 551 NEAs (6 % of the total number of this type of asteroids). Even more remarkable is the fact that these results have been obtained at zero cost to telescope time as NEAs were serendipitously observed while the survey was being carried out. This demonstrates the enormous scientific potential hidden in astronomical archives. The great reception of the project as well as the results obtained makes it a valuable and reliable tool for improving the orbital parameters of near-Earth asteroids.", "title": ["Precovery of near-Earth asteroids by a citizen-science project of the Spanish Virtual Observatory"], "year": "2014"}

{"abstract": "We have studied numerically the dynamical evolution of the two near-Earth asteroids (433) Eros and (4660) Nereus, to be explored by planned space missions in the next decade, over a time scale of 2Myr. For each real asteroid, we integrated a set of several initially \"indistinguishable\" orbits (clones), obtained either by small variations of the nominal initial conditions, or by using different computers (introducing different round-off errors). As for Nereus, its orbital evolution is typically dominated by Earth encounters, causing a random walk in semimajor axis. Protection mechanisms related to secular and mean motion resonances are often temporarily at work, but are not likely to increase much Nereus' lifetime. According to our results, it is unlikely that this (C-type) NEA comes from a comet-like initial orbit, or at least that such a transition has occurred in the last =~10Myr. As for Eros, 5/8 clones always stay in the Mars-crossing, Amor-like region, but 3 of them become Earth-crossers within the 2Myr of our integration time span, and indeed one of them was observed to hit the Earth after 1.14Myr. Therefore an Earth impact by this 20-km sized NEA is unlikely but not impossible in the next 10^6^-10^8^yr.

{"abstract": "The Yarkovsky effect is a non-radiative force that can modify the orbits of small celestial bodies, resulting in a slow expansion or contraction of the orbits over time. The effect is subtle (da/dt ~ 10<SUP>-4</SUP> au/My for a 1 km diameter object) and is thus generally difficult to measure. We analyzed both optical and radar astrometry for 600 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) for the purpose of detecting and quantifying the Yarkovsky effect. We present measured drift rates for 247 NEAs, which is the largest published set of Yarkovsky detections [Greenberg et al., 2020]. We examine the efficiency with which solar energy is converted into orbital energy and find a median efficiency in our sample of 12%. We interpret this efficiency in terms of NEA spin and thermal properties. Our large sample size provides an opportunity to examine the Yarkovsky effect in a statistical manner. In particular, we describe two independent population-based tests that confirm the hypothesis of Yarkovsky orbital drift. First, we provide observational confirmation for the Yarkovsky effect's theoretical size dependence of 1/D, where D is diameter, refuting an earlier claim that suggested otherwise. Second, we find that the observed ratio of negative to positive drift rates in our sample is 2.34, which, accounting for sampling bias, implies an actual ratio of approximately 2.7. This ratio has a vanishingly small probability of occurring due to chance or statistical noise. It also highlights a serious, unresolved discrepancy with predictions: the observed ratio is two times lower than the ratio expected from numerical predictions from NEA population studies and traditional assumptions about the sense of rotation of NEAs originating from various main belt escape routes. Finally, we find that each additional apparition with radar ranging observations decreases uncertainties on the estimate of the Yarkovsky drift rate by a factor of approximately two, emphasizing the critical importance of radar astrometry in the NEA trajectory prediction and hazard mitigation problems.", "title": ["Measurement of Yarkovsky Drift Rates for 247 Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2020"}

{"abstract": "The NEAR mission was a spectacular rehearsal for one of the most exciting and scientifically rewarding missions of the next decade, sample return from near-Earth asteroids. A unique source of information about the early solar system, the formation of the planets, and the connection between stars and our Sun, are meteorites and asteroids. Yet, studies of both are hindered by a lack of unequivocal and detailed information linking the two. Meteorites are rock samples of unknown provenance. We have no information about the geological context of their source. They are also highly non-representative sampling of primitive solar system material because the terrestrial meteorite population is dominated by the ejecta of stochastic impacts and because the atmosphere filters out all but the toughest rocks. Without sample return, asteroids are not amenable to the depth and breadth of techniques available in the laboratory, yet the NEAR images indicate that there are many processes occurring on asteroids - or that could have occurred in the past - that we must understand if the meteorite data are ever to yield a clear image of early solar system processes. Technical developments of the last few years and the discovery of large numbers of NEAs mean that sample return is now within small mission capability. A team of about 20 scientists and engineers from all relevant subject fields are now assembling a mission called Hera.

{"abstract": "In conjunction with JPL's Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT)program (see submitted Helin et al abstract), SkyMorph is an archive of NEAT observational images available for public access via the World Wide Web. SkyMorph covers much of the sky with emphasis along the ecliptic plane. Motion and brightness changes can be detected because each area of the sky is reobserved at different timescales (half-hourly, daily, yearly). As a result, one can detect asteroids, comets, high-proper motion stars, novae, and supernovae to name a few. Upon viewing the data, SkyMorph includes the RA and Dec of all detected objects, their magnitudes and lightcurves. Currently, SkyMorph contains 75 nights of data consisting of over 29,500 images and covering nearly 74,000 sq. deg. The majority of the images are obtained with the 4096 x 4096 NEAT CCD camera mounted on a U. S. Air Force 1 meter telescope on Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii. Each image is 2.6 sq. deg. (1.6 deg. on each side) and is 33.3 Mb in size. NEAT has observed monthly since December 1995 with 213 nights of observations. As NEAT observations continue, the SkyMorph database will be updated. The unprocessed nights of data are being added at a rate of one night per day. HAVANA (the Horizons Assisted Vehicle for Accessing the NEAT Archive) is a newly deployed software package that enables automated searches for specific asteroids through the extensive Skymorph database. Utilizing the JPL on-line ephemeris program, Horizons, to generate an orbit for the user's object of interest, HAVANA compares the position of the object in space and time with all the archived image fields and retrieves sub-images from each field containing the object.

{"abstract": "Context. In the past decades near-Earth objects (NEOs) have become very important targets to study, since they can give us clues to the formation, evolution, and composition of the solar system. In addition, they may represent either a threat to humankind or a repository of extraterrestrial resources for suitable space-borne missions. Within this framework, the choice of next-generation mission targets and the characterisation of a potential threat to our planet deserve special attention. <BR /> Aims: To date, only a small part of the 11 000 discovered NEOs have been physically characterised. From ground- and space-based observations, one can determine some basic physical properties of these objects using visible and infrared spectroscopy. <BR /> Methods: We present data for 13 objects observed with different telescopes around the world (NASA-IRTF, ESO-NTT, TNG) in the 0.4-2.5 \u03bcm spectral range, within the NEOSURFACE survey. Objects are chosen from among the more accessible for a rendez-vous mission. All of them are characterised by a delta-V (the change in velocity needed for transferring a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit to a rendez-vous with NEOs) lower than 10.5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, well below the solar system escape velocity (12.3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). <BR /> Results: We taxonomically classify 9 of these objects for the first time. Eleven objects belong to the S-complex taxonomy, and the other 2 belong to the C-complex. We constrain the surface composition of these objects by comparing their spectra with meteorites from the RELAB database. We also compute olivine and pyroxene mineralogy for asteroids with clear evidence of pyroxene bands. Mineralogy confirms the similarity with the already found H, L, or LL ordinary chondrite analogues. <P />Based on observations carried out at the European Southern Observatory - NTT (Programs 075.C-0282, 076.C-0577 and 078.C-0141), NASA - IRTF (Program 087) and Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (Sessions AOT14-TAC41, AOT15-TAC69 and AOT26-TAC32.)", "title": ["Low delta-V near-Earth asteroids: A survey of suitable targets for space missions"], "year": "2014"}
{"abstract": "The near-Earth asteroid (NEA) (175706) 1996 FG<SUB>3</SUB> is a particularly interesting spacecraft target: a binary asteroid with a low-\u0394v heliocentric orbit. The orbit of its satellite has provided valuable information about its mass density while its albedo and colors suggest it is primitive or part of the C-complex taxonomic grouping. We extend the physical characterization of this object with new observations of its emission at mid-infrared wavelengths and with near-infrared reflection spectroscopy. We derive an area-equivalent system diameter of 1.90 \u00b1 0.28 km (corresponding to approximate component diameters of 1.83 km and 0.51 km, respectively) and a geometric albedo of 0.039 \u00b1 0.012.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroid (385186) 1994 AW1 was discovered at Palomar Observatory on 11 January 1994. Subsequent observations of this Amor family, Sa-class asteroid also identified it as the first candidate binary NEA, as indicated by multiple periodicities and possible mutual eclipsing/occulting events in the object\u2019s lightcurve. On 15 July 2015 this asteroid made its closest approach to Earth since its discovery, coming within 0.065 AU (25 lunar distances), and prompting an extended observation campaign using both the JPL-Goldstone and Arecibo Observatory planetary radars. Goldstone observations covered the 14-19 July period of closest approach (0.066-0.070 AU) while the object remained below Arecibo\u2019s observing horizon, with Arecibo picking up the observations between 20-30 July, as the object moved from 0.075 to 0.126 AU distance. At Goldstone, we were able to observe this object with range resolutions of 150 m using a Goldstone (DSS-14) to Green Bank Telescope (GBT) bistatic configuration, while at Arecibo, we conducted monostatic observations of 1994 AW1 using the 2380 MHz (12.6 cm) radar at resolutions of 30 m and 75 m.As a result, and twenty years after its discovery, these observations have confirmed the binary nature of 1994 AW1, showing the primary body to be about 600 m in diameter, the secondary body to be about half the diameter of the primary, with the two orbiting a common center of mass at a distance of about 1.2 km apart. Delay-Doppler image comparisons of the primary over the course of six nights (at 30 m resolution) confirm a lightcurve-derived rotation period of 2.518 +/- 0.002 hr, as &gt;90% longitude coverage was achieved, revealing a slightly elongated, irregular surface morphology. Delay-Doppler images of the secondary reveal an elongated, irregular body which appears to be tidally locked, with its long axis pointed towards the primary as it orbits with a period of about 22 hr (also consistent with the lightcurve analysis). These very early results point to a total system mass of (1.6 +/- 0.5) x 10^11 kg and a crude, mean system density estimate of 1400 +/- 500 kg/m^3.

{"abstract": "Rotations of asteroids have been set and altered by several processes since their formation. In the case of the near-Earth objects (NEOs), the rotational states are significantly affected by non-gravitational effects. In addition, an abundant population of binary systems has been found among NEOs with rotational periods very close to the spin barrier and in the size range from 0.2 to 10 km. In this paper we report photometric observations of about 80 NEAs carried out with the 1-m telescope of the Observat\u00f3rio Astron\u00f4mico do Sert\u00e3o de Itaparica (OASI, Brazil) from 2016 October to 2020 December. Reliable rotational periods and lightcurve amplitudes were determined for 46 objects, of which 15 are Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). A minimum period value was also derived for other 11 NEOs. Then, asteroids with rotation periods between 2 and 3 h had their lightcurves analyzed for binarity signatures. We analyzed 21 binary candidates and for 8 of them we found the signature of a possible satellite. These suspected binaries showed a single possible mutual event or a secondary period superimposed on the lightcurve. Primary lightcurves for 6 confirmed binary NEOs were also obtained and for some of them the orbital period was also determined. Finally, we show that binary candidates require some internal cohesion strength to avoid structural failure by centrifugal forces.", "title": ["Lightcurve analysis of near-Earth objects from the IMPACTON project: Evidence of binary systems and cohesion strength"], "year": "2023"}

{"abstract": "Asteroids are diverse and numerous solar system objects, from the large number of objects in the main asteroid belt to the relatively small near-Earth population. Understanding their physical properties is essential to understanding the evolution of the solar system, and asteroid morphology is a complex field in its own right. The histories of individual asteroids, and particularly near-Earth objects, reflect continuous interaction among their shapes, rotation states, and orbits due to the effects of radiation pressure. Radar astronomy has provided detailed information on the orbits, sizes, shapes, rotation states, and composition of many asteroids. To improve the capabilities of asteroid radar observations, I have developed the technique of radar speckle tracking. The echoes from different points on the surface of a radar target interfere with each other, producing a pattern of bright and dark speckles across the surface of the Earth. Using radio astronomy techniques, I track the motion of speckles between several ground stations during a radar experiment to accurately determine the rotation state of the target. Speckle tracking is a powerful tool to both determine the orbital evolution of near-Earth asteroids, particularly potential Earth impactors, and to survey the overall physical properties of the asteroid population. In addition, I have studied applying the techniques of adaptive optics and radio interferometry to asteroid science. These will become more useful with the next generation of asteroid-detecting surveys and the construction of large sub-millimeter interferometers. Interferometry in particular will soon be able to survey the entire asteroid belt.", "title": ["Shapes and Spins of Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2010"}

We consider five increasingly complex trajectory models: impulsive, Lambert, nuclear electric propulsion, nuclear electric propulsion including the Earth's gravity, solar electric propulsion including the Earth's gravity and we study the final correlation between the obtained target rankings. We find that the use of a low-thrust trajectory model is of great importance for target selection, since the use of chemical propulsion surrogates leads to favouring less attractive options 19% of times, a percentage that drops to 8% already using a simple nuclear electric propulsion model that neglects the Earth's gravity effects and thrust dependence on the solar distance.

{"abstract": "The near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) represent excellent scientific opportunities to study the dynamical and physical properties of small bodies of the Solar System. Moreover, the celestial bodies with sizes lower than one km can be studied using a variety of techniques, thanks to the fact that they come close to Earth orbit.We report the preliminary results of an ongoing observational program for obtaining the visible color indexes of NEAs. Our survey use the MuSCAT2 instrument [1] mounted on the 1.52 m Telescopio Carlos S\u00e1nchez located at Teide Observatory (Canary Islands, Spain). The setup allows us to obtain simultaneous imaging in the g (400-550nm), r (550-700 nm), i( 700-820 nm), and zs (820-920nm) bands. The visible colors have proven to be efficient to broadly differentiate between the major compositional groups [2]. Thus, by using MuSCAT2 instrument we can obtain the spectro-photometric classification for a large number of NEOs. The simultaneous imaging allows to study the relation between the rotational properties and the taxonomic type. It can also reveal possible heterogeneous compositions of the observed targets.Fig. 1 The absolute magnitude distribution of NEAs observed with TCS - MuSCAT2 instrumentThe program started in March 2018 with one or two observing nights allocated on every month. A total of 267 spectro-photometric observational sets were collected. They correspond to 198 NEAs with the absolute magnitudes distributed in the range of 12 -24 mag (Fig. 1). Our schedule gave priority to the targets observed by radar, to potentially hazardous asteroids and to those suitable for a space mission. We also considered the newly discovered objects. Most of these are very small objects (in general smaller than 300m) and the opportunities to study them are rare.Fig. 2 The color-color diagrams of objects with known visible colors and spectral classification, used as training sets in the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.We used the Photometry Pipeline (PP) software [3] and several Python scripts for reducing the data. We applied the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to obtain the spectro-photometric classification. For the training set we used the 86 asteroids for which spectral data is also available and the taxonomic type is known ([4], [5]). We grouped the taxonomic classes in seven groups, namely Q-type and S-complex (similar to silicate asteroids), V-type (specific to basaltic objects), A-type (an olivine-dominated composition), B/C-complex (similar to carbonaceous meteorites), X-complex and D-type (reddish surfaces - possible cometary nature). The color-color diagrams of this sample used for training is shown in Fig. 2. The classification results are shown in Fig. 3.Fig 3. The taxonomic distribution of the observed sampleBy assigning a probability for each classification we quantified the effect of color errors. This was derived by applying a Monte-Carlo approach. We generated 10000 simulated values for each of the colors of an asteroid by using a normal distribution where the mean is the observed color and the standard deviation is the color error. The KNN classifier was applied for each of these colors. The reported class is the one predicted in most cases and the probability is the occurrence rate.AcknowledgmentsMP, JL, JdL, and DM acknowledge support from the ESA P3NEOI and NEOROCKS projects.

Spectral band parameters, like band centers, are derived and compared to spectra of laboratory mineral mixtures and meteorites to constrain their composition and possible meteorite analogs. Based on our study we estimate the albedos and diameters of these NEAs and compare them with those obtained by other techniques such as ground-based mid-infrared, Spitzer thermal infrared and Arecibo radar. Our results are broadly consistent with the results from other direct methods like radar. Determining the compositions of low albedo asteroids is a challenge due to the lack of deep silicate absorption features. However, based on weak absorption features and albedo, we suggest possible meteorite analogs for these NEAs, which include black chondrites, CM2 carbonaceous chondrites and enstatite achondrites.

{"abstract": "We consider the perturbations on near-earth asteroid orbits due to various forces stemming from solar radiation. We find that the existence of precise radar astrometric observations at multiple apparitions, spanning periods on the order of 10 years, allows the detection of such forces on bodies as large as kilometer across. Indeed, the perturbations are so substantial that certain of the forces can be essential to fit an orbit to the observations. In particular, we show that the recoil force of thermal radiation from the asteroid, known as the Yarkovsky effect, is the most important of these unmodeled perturbations. We also show that the effect of reflected light can be important if even moderate albedo variations are present, while moderate changes in oblateness appear to have a far smaller effect. An unexpected result is that the Poynting\u2013Robertson effect, typically only considered for submillimeter dust particles, could be observable on smaller asteroids with high eccentricity, such as 1566 Icarus. Finally, we also study the possibility of improving the orbit uncertainty through well-timed optical observations which might help in better detection of these nongravitational perturbations.", "title": ["On the observability of radiation forces acting on near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2001"}

We find the constraint of observation ability can lead to selection effect on the discoveries, which causes a yearly dependence trend and a size-dependence characteristic of the relative proportion for different orbit types of discovered NEAs. Besides, combined with the orbits obtained from numerical simulations, we revisit the discovery scenarios of these objects. The position distribution of the objects under different celestial coordinate systems are obtained, and the dependence on seasons, observatory latitudes, and the diameters are analyzed. Finally, we quantify the impact of the Sun, the Moon, and the galactic plane on the discoveries by analyzing the observation data, and find that ground-based telescopes generally have difficulty in discovering NEAs within 90<SUP>\u2218</SUP> from the Sun direction, and that this limitation generally has a greater impact on smaller-sized objects. The lunar position also has a significant effect on the discoveries, with the restriction on the nights before and after the full Moon resulting in 29% of NEAs being undiscovered, and analysis shows that objects found in the first half of the lunar calendar month are generally more difficult to be followed than those found in the second half. The galactic plane, especially the direction near the galactic center, also has an effect on the discoveries, resulting in a season-dependent \"blind spot\" for observations near the ecliptic.", "title": ["Statistical Analysis on the Number of Discoveries and Discovery Scenarios of Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2023"}

{"abstract": "The observed near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population contains very few objects with small perihelion distances, say, $q \\lesssim 0.2\\, \\mathrm{au}$. NEAs that currently have orbits with larger q might be hiding a past evolution during which they have approached closer to the Sun. We present a probabilistic assessment of the minimum q that an asteroid has reached during its orbital history. At the same time, we offer an estimate of the dwell time, that is, the time q has been in a specific range. We have re-analysed orbital integrations of test asteroids from the moment they enter the near-Earth region until they either collide with a major body or are thrown out from the inner Solar system. We considered a total disruption of asteroids at certain q as a function of absolute magnitude (H). We calculated the probability that an asteroid with given orbital elements and H has reached a q smaller than a given threshold value and its respective dwell time in that range. We have constructed a look-up table that can be used to study the past orbital and thermal evolution of asteroids as well as meteorite falls and their possible parent bodies. An application to 25 meteorite falls shows that carbonaceous chondrites typically have short dwell times at small q, whereas for ordinary chondrites it ranges from $10\\, 000$ to $500\\, 000$ yr. A dearth of meteorite falls with long dwell times and small minimum q supports a supercatastrophic disruption of asteroids at small q.", "title": ["Minimum perihelion distances and associated dwell times for near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "The Desert Research and Technology Studies (D-RATS) 2011 field test involved the planning and execution of a series of exploration scenarios under operational conditions similar to those expected during a human exploration mission to a near-Earth asteroid (NEA). The focus was on understanding the operations tempo during simulated NEA exploration and the implications of communications latency and limited data bandwidth. Anchoring technologies and sampling techniques were not evaluated due to the immaturity of those technologies and the inability to meaningfully test them at D-RATS. Reduced gravity analogs and simulations are being used to fully evaluate Space Exploration Vehicle (SEV) and extravehicular (EVA) operations and interactions in near-weightlessness at a NEA as part of NASA's integrated analogs program. Hypotheses were tested by planning and performing a series of 1-day simulated exploration excursions comparing test conditions all of which involved a single Deep Space Habitat (DSH) and either 0, 1, or 2 SEVs; 3 or 4 crewmembers; 1 of 2 different communications bandwidths; and a 50-second each-way communications latency between the field site and Houston. Excursions were executed at the Black Point Lava Flow test site with a remote Mission Control Center and Science Support Room at Johnson Space Center (JSC) being operated with 50-second each-way communication latency to the field. Crews were composed of astronauts and professional field geologists. Teams of Mission Operations and Science experts also supported the mission simulations each day. Data were collected separately from the Crew, Mission Operations, and Science teams to assess the test conditions from multiple perspectives. For the operations tested, data indicates practically significant benefits may be realized by including at least one SEV and by including 4 versus 3 crewmembers in the NEA exploration architecture as measured by increased scientific data quality, EVA exploration time, capability assessment ratings, and consensus acceptability ratings provided by Crew, Mission Operations, and Science teams. A combination of text and voice was used to effectively communicate over the communications latency, and increased communication bandwidth yielded a small but practically significant improvement in overall acceptability as rated by the Science team, although the impact of bandwidth on scientific strategic planning and public outreach was not assessed. No effect of increased bandwidth was observed with respect to Crew or Mission Operations team ratings of overall acceptability.", "title": ["Desert RATS 2011: Human and robotic exploration of near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2013"}

{"abstract": "In 1995 asteroid 6489 Golevka (1991 IX) had a close encounter with the Earth at a distance of 0.034 AU, providing a good opportunity for a detailed study of a small Solar System object. In this paper we report the results of an extensive international observing campaign aimed at determining Golevka's rotational and physical properties from optical photometry and thermal W radiometry. From the analysis of photometric light curves we derive a spin axis model whose coordinates are \u03bb<SUB>p</SUB> (J2000)=347\u00b0\u00b110\u00b0 and \u03b2<SUB>p</SUB> (J2000)=350\u00b0\u00b110\u00b0. The strict periodicity observed in light curves taken during virtually constant illumination and observing conditions argues against free precession of the spin vector. The rotation is prograde with a sidereal period P<SUB>sid</SUB>=0.251101 d (6.02640\u00b10.00024 hr). The derived ellipsoidal shape model results in a/b 1.4\u00b10.2 while not satisfactorily constraining the b/c ratio. No systematic V-R color index variation larger than 0.005 mag (1\u03c3) was observed, suggesting a spectrally uniform surface on a hemispheric scale. The integral phase curve is moderately well represented by the H-G parameter system that fails, however, to reproduce the observed opposition spike. We derive mean H, G values of 19.074\u00b10.029 and 0.138\u00b10.013, respectively. The application of the more accurate Hapke photometric function produces a better fit and allows us to describe the surface scattering properties in terms of model parameters: \u03c3\u203e=7\u00b0\u00b17\u00b0,g=-0.435\u00b10.001, \u03c9<SUB>0</SUB>=0.58\u00b10.03, h=0.0114\u00b10.0004, B<SUB>0</SUB>=0.758\u00b10.014. Infrared measurements reveal that the flux at 10.6 \u03bcm is unusually small in view of the object's optical brightness. The combined application of a modified Fast Rotating Thermal Model and of the photometric model suggests that Golevka is a small body with approximate dimensions (0.35\u00d70.25\u00d70.25 km) and a very high geometric albedo P<SUB>v</SUB>\u223c0.6.

{"abstract": "Here we explore a technique for constraining physical properties of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) based on variability in thermal emission as a function of viewing aspect. We present case studies of the low albedo, near-Earth asteroids (285263) 1998 QE2 and (175706) 1996 FG3. The Near-Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM) is used to fit signatures of thermal emission in near-infrared (0.8 - 2.5 \u03bcm) spectral data. This analysis represents a systematic study of thermal variability in the near-IR as a function of phase angle. The observations of QE2 imply that carefully timed observations from multiple viewing geometries can be used to constrain physical properties like retrograde versus prograde pole orientation and thermal inertia. The FG3 results are more ambiguous with detected thermal variability possibly due to systematic issues with NEATM, an unexpected prograde rotation state, or a surface that is spectrally and thermally heterogenous. This study highlights the potential diagnostic importance of high phase angle thermal measurements on both sides of opposition. We find that the NEATM thermal beaming parameters derived from our near-IR data tend to be of order10's of percent higher than parameters from ensemble analyses of longer wavelength data sets. However, a systematic comparison of NEATM applied to data in different wavelength regimes is needed to understand whether this offset is simply a reflection of small number statistics or an intrinsic limitation of NEATM when applied to near-IR data. With the small sample presented here, it remains unclear whether NEATM modeling at near-IR wavelengths can robustly determine physical properties like pole orientation and thermal inertia.", "title": ["Near-infrared thermal emission from near-Earth asteroids: Aspect-dependent variability"], "year": "2017"}

{"abstract": "The impact probability of a given asteroid with the Earth depends strongly on the details of its orbit, i.e. orbits which intersect the Earth's orbit at low inclination or nearly tangent at perihelion or aphelion have much higher impact probabilities than more steeply crossing orbits. Since the Earth may clear out objects in such orbits faster than they are supplied, the actual distribution of such orbits may be highly non-random, and thus the collision frequency from the actual equilibrium population is difficult to model theoretically. I have taken a direct approach to estimating the current impact flux by using the sample of all discovered NEAs with absolute magnitude less than 18.0 (approximately 1 km in diameter or larger). This provides a large enough sample, more than 600 objects, to provide good statistics of impact frequency, and yet is relatively unbiased since it is expected to be more than half complete of all existing NEAs that large. Of this sample, approximately half are Earth-crossing asteroids (have perihelia less than 1.0 AU and thus can impact the Earth at some time in the normal precessional cycle of their orbits. I compute the circumstances of passages of all these objects within 0.1 AU of the Earth over a period of one century (in the future to remove any bias from the discovery apparition). The frequency of passages within 0.1 AU can be easily scaled to obtain the frequency of passages within the Earth's radius, with allowance for gravitational focusing, and thereby obtain an estimate of the impact frequency of the actual observed population of NEAs. The result is that the ''per object'' impact frequency of all NEAs (q &lt; 1.3 AU) is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP> y<SUP>-1</SUP>. An associated result is the RMS impact velocity, which is about 20 km/sec. <P />This research will hopefully be funded by the Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program of NASA, when 2003 funding finally gets released.", "title": ["The Impact Frequency of Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2003"}
{"abstract": "In this study, we analyzed photometric data in the o- and c-band of the asteroid (3200) Phaethon from the ATLAS network from 2015 to 2024. Apparent magnitudes and phase angles were used to construct phase curves. Annual data sets were analyzed if the phase angle range was at least 15 degrees. The phase coefficients for 2021 and 2022 were negative and positive, respectively. Negative coefficients are unusual for asteroids and likely result from variations in the observed hemisphere due to changes in the viewing angle relative to Phaethon's rotation axis. In 2021, the northern hemisphere was observed, while in 2022 the southern hemisphere was observed. In December 2017, negative slopes G were derived from the VRI phase curves, corresponding to a sub-Earth latitude of 46 degrees N. Using the G value in the R-band, we have obtained the approximate parameters of the Hapke model for the northern hemisphere of Phaethon, suggesting that its surface consists of particles with similar porosity or size distribution, a rougher surface, and stronger backward scattering compared to typical low-albedo asteroids, and possibly also compared to the southern region. The northern hemisphere of Phaethon is likely redder than its southern hemisphere, which is supported by the absolute color c-o estimates in 2022 showing that the southern region is bluer than the solar twin YBP 1194, the main-belt comet 107P/Wilson-Harrington, and even than the C-type asteroid (10) Hygiea.

Potentially Hazardous Objects are a subgroup of about 2000 NEOs on orbits that can make close approaches to the Earth and large enough to cause significant regional damage in the event of impact. More precisely, a NEO is a PHA if its minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) with respect to Earth is less than 0.05 AU - about 19.5 lunar distances - and its absolute magnitude is brighter than 22, approximately corresponding to a diameter larger than 140 meters. Part of them has known orbits, and others are currently discovered and need rapid spectrophotometric investigation.Their observation is particularly challenging because of their typical faintness and their high rate of velocity.With our observations we aim to perform the taxonomic classification of the objects, the study of their surface compositon and possible heterogeneity and the comparison with meteorites taken from known catalogues in order to investigate better the nature of the observed objects. The program is ongoing since its beginning in January 2020. The collaboration with the other members of the team, for example those performing photometric observations, further completes the study of these objects.ObservationsThe data are obtained at the 1.22m Galileo Telescope and at the 1.80m Copernico Telescope at the Asiago Observatory, Italy. The Galileo Telescope is equipped with a Boller &amp; Chivens spectrograph, the Copernico Telescope is equipped with AFOSC (Asiago Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera), for a spectral range 0.4-1 micron. The spectra are reduced using the standard IRAF routine and normalized at 0.55 micron. We have applied a median filter at 3 sigma to remove the cosmic rays and the spurious features (see Fig.1 with some examples of the obtained spectra).ResultsSince the beginning of the project, January 2020, in spite of the many problems caused by the pandemic as for example the closure of the Observatories to the observers for several months assuring only service mode, we have observed about 30 objects. Some of them are new discovered NEOs, including many PHAs, with size range from 60m to about 3000m. Most of them have not a taxonomic classification or not a clear one yet. We perform the taxonomic classification through a comparison with spectral type spectra from Bus-Binzel Taxonomy (2002) and with laboratory meteorites spectra from Relab database (http://www.planetary.brown.edu/relabdocs/relab.htm), using a least square method to obtain the best fit. We have found different types of asteroids, spanning from carbonaceous C to silicate S, and even more rare types as O or B. Some of the objects (eg, 1998 OR2) have been investigated spectroscopically along their known rotational period. This gives the further opportunity to investigate the surface variegation of the objects that, in some cases (when pole solution is known), we can also interpret in terms of observational surface coverage and therefore in terms of latitudinal and/or longitudinal surface variations (see Fig. 2 for an example). The observational campaign is still ongoing, we plan to add more objects to this survey and here we will present the preliminary results.ReferencesBus, S. J., and R. P. Binzel 2002.

We have chosen, for our sampling target, an asteroid from the basaltic class (V-type), as asteroids in this class exhibit spectral signatures that resemble those of the well-studied Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite (HED) meteorite suite. With this mission, we expect to answer specific questions about the links between differentiated meteorites and asteroids, as well as gain further insight into the broader issues of early Solar System (SS) evolution and the formation of terrestrial planets. To achieve the mission, we designed a spacecraft with a dry mass of less than 3 tonnes that uses electric propulsion with a solar-electric power supply of 15 kW at 1 Astronomical Unit (AU). The mission includes a series of remote sensing instruments, envisages landing of the whole spacecraft on the sampling target, and employs an innovative sampling mechanism. Launch is foreseen to occur in 2018, as the designed timetable, and the mission would last about 10 years, bringing back a 150 g subsurface sample within a small re-entry capsule.

{"abstract": "We report the results of position, photometric, and polarimetric observations of two near-Earth asteroids made with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. 1.2-hour measurements of the photometric variations of the asteroid 2009 DL46 made onMarch 8, 2016 (approximately 20<SUP>m</SUP> at a distance of about 0.23 AU from the Earth) showed a 0.<SUP>m</SUP>2-amplitude flash with a duration of about 20 minutes. During this time the polarization degree increased from the average level of 2\u20133% to 14%. The angle of the polarization plane and the phase angle were equal to 113\u00b0 \u00b1 1\u00b0 and 43\u00b0, respectively. Our result indicates that the surface of the rotating asteroid (the rotation period of about 2.5 hours) must be non-uniformly rough. Observations of another asteroid\u20141994 UG\u2014whose brightness was of about 17<SUP>m</SUP> and which was located at a geocentric distance of 0.077 AU, were carried out during the night of March 6/7, 2016 in two modes: photometric and spectropolarimetric. According to the results of photometric observations in Johnson's B-, V-, and R-band filters, over one hour the brightness of the asteroid remained unchanged within the measurement errors (about 0.<SUP>m</SUP>02). Spectropolarimetric observations in the 420\u2013800 nm wavelength interval showed the polarization degree to decrease from 8% in the blue part of the spectrum to 2% in the red part with the phase angle equal to 44\u25e6, which is typical for S-type near-Earth asteroids.", "title": ["Observations of Near-Earth Asteroids in Polarized Light"], "year": "2018"}

{"abstract": "THE orbits of comets and near-Earth asteroids evolve chaotically, mainly in response to the gravitational influence of the planets.

Of the 47 objects studied, we found 19 cases in which the asteroid collided with the Sun, implying that solar collisions are a more common fate than planetary collisions or ejection from the Solar System.

{"abstract": "The Asteroid Impact &amp; Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission will be the first space experiment to demonstrate asteroid impact hazard mitigation by using a kinetic impactor to deflect an asteroid. AIDA is an international cooperation, consisting of two mission elements: the NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission and the ESA Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM) rendezvous mission. The primary goals of AIDA are (i) to test our ability to perform a spacecraft impact on a potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroid and (ii) to measure and characterize the deflection caused by the impact. The AIDA target will be the binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos, with the deflection experiment to occur in late September, 2022. The DART impact on the secondary member of the binary at 7 km/s is expected to alter the binary orbit period by about 4 minutes, assuming a simple transfer of momentum to the target, and this period change will be measured by Earth-based observatories. The AIM spacecraft will characterize the asteroid target and monitor results of the impact in situ at Didymos. The DART mission is a full-scale kinetic impact to deflect a 150 m diameter asteroid, with known impactor conditions and with target physical properties characterized by the AIM mission. Predictions for the momentum transfer efficiency of kinetic impacts are given for several possible target types of different porosities, using Housen and Holsapple (2011) crater scaling model for impact ejecta mass and velocity distributions. Results are compared to numerical simulation results using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code of Jutzi and Michel (2014) with good agreement. The model also predicts that the ejecta from the DART impact may make Didymos into an active asteroid, forming an ejecta coma that may be observable from Earth-based telescopes. The measurements from AIDA of the momentum transfer from the DART impact, the crater size and morphology, and the evolution of an ejecta coma will substantially advance understanding of impact processes on asteroids.", "title": ["Asteroid Impact &amp; Deflection Assessment mission: Kinetic impactor"], "year": "2016"}
{"title": ["Non-impact origin of crater-like features on top-shape near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2022", "abstract": "Introduction:To understand the long-term history and age of a planetary surface, it is important to analyze the distribution of impact craters, including the case of fast-spinning asteroids. Two of such asteroids have recently been visited by space probes such as the Hayabusa2 and the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft that targeted the C-type and B-type asteroids (162173) Ryugu and (101955) Bennu, respectively. These NEAs have been found to share similar physical and morphological characteristics, including low bulk density, surface characterized by large blocks and boulders, and top-shape profiles [1, 2]. Moreover, on the surface of both small bodies, several geological features can be identified in detail, such as crater-like features, boulders, linear features, fossae, etc [e.g., 1, 3]. Many crater-like depressions can be identified over the surface strongly skewed towards low equatorial latitudes. This uneven global distribution suggests that different evolutionary and impact history took place at the equatorial ridge with respect to the rest of the body.Such bodies likely aggregated gravitationally right after the catastrophic collision that originated them [4]. In addition, collisions in the main belt and lately the YORP effect may have contributed to modify their spin rate. For instance, they have been found to be currently slowly spinning up (Bennu) and down (Ryugu) by YORP [5, 6]. The past spinning history of such bodies is unknown, however they may have had spin rates fast enough to cause the detachment of boulders from their surface eventually falling back onto them. Under such conditions, the formation of currently observed crater-like depressions may not be necessarily related to impact events and may rather be the outcome of repeated boulder landing and taking off cycles.Here, we focus on checking the potential correlation between the formation of depressions and crater-like features with the dynamical behaviour of boulders on Ryugu and Bennu like-asteroids. Methodology:We use the global mosaic of images available for Ryugu and Bennu asteroids created by using data collected from OCAMS and ONCs cameras suites overlapped to shape models [2, 7] to identify and map the characteristic features which we are interested in.To check our hypothesis on the origin of crater-like features, we developed a two-stage model research, based on: (1) dynamical study of lifted particles due to fast spin, and (2) modelling the movement of big boulders using a N-body Discrete Element Method (PKDGRAV. [8,9]). In the first stage, we analyze the dynamics of particles that can detach from the surface of Ryugu and Bennu at a time they were spinning fast enough so that apparent centrifugal acceleration is sufficient to overcome local gravity. We therefore integrate the equation of motion of sample particles in a non-inertial rotating reference frame [10]. Sample particles -representing blocks and boulders- are initially placed at the center of the triangular facets in the shape model of each asteroid [2, 7]. Their dynamical evolution in time is followed and their trajectory and behaviour is tracked. Particle detachment from the surface at the critical spin state, and the landing latitude on the asteroid surface is also analyzed. In the second stage, we use PKDGRAV to place boulders on the asteroid surface and follow their dynamical evolution at an increasing spin rate.Summary:Our model of boulder motion on asteroids Bennu and Ryugu under fast spin conditions shows the formation of depressions and crater-like features due to boulder detaching, landing and/or bouncing off their surface is possible. Also, final landing of boulders at high latitudes is found. This model suggests a potential explanation for the crater abundance observed around the equatorial region in Ryugu and Bennu. In near future, the DART (NASA, 2022) and Hera (ESA, 2026) space missions are scheduled to approach the NEA binary system (65803) Didymos. The primary of such system is also a top-shape fast-spinning asteroid for which we may expect similar features as those studied in Bennu and Ryugu.Acknowledgements:LMP, NET and ACB acknowledge funding from the NEO-MAPP project (H2020-EU-2-1-6/870377).

{"abstract": "Context. The near-Earth asteroid (1917) Cuyo was subject to radar and light curve observations during a close approach in 1989, and observed up until 2008. It was selected as one of our ESO Large Programme targets, aimed at observational detections of the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect through long-term light curve monitoring and physical modelling of near-Earth asteroids. <BR /> Aims: We aim to constrain the physical properties of Cuyo: shape, spin-state, and spectroscopic and thermo-physical properties of the surface. <BR /> Methods: We acquired photometric light curves of Cuyo spanning the period between 2010 and 2013, which we combined with published light curves from 1989 to 2008. Our thermal-infrared observations were obtained in 2011. Rotationally resolved optical spectroscopy data were acquired in 2011 and combined with all available published spectra to investigate any surface material variegation. <BR /> Results: We developed a convex light curve-inversion shape of Cuyo that suggests the presence of an equatorial ridge, typical for an evolved system close to shedding mass due to fast rotation. We determine limits of YORP strength through light curve-based spin-state modelling, including both negative and positive acceleration values, between - 0.7 \u00d7 10<SUP>-8</SUP> and 1.7 \u00d7 10<SUP>-8</SUP> rad day<SUP>-2</SUP>. Thermo-physical modelling with the ATPM provides constraints on the geometric albedo, p<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.24 \u00b1 0.07, the effective diameter, D<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3.15 \u00b1 0.08 km, the thermal inertia, \u0393 = 44 \u00b1 9 J m<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1/2</SUP> K<SUP>-1</SUP>, and a roughness fraction of 0.52 \u00b1 0.26. This enabled a YORP strength prediction of \u03bd = (-6.39 \u00b1 0.96) \u00d7 10<SUP>-10</SUP> rad day<SUP>-2</SUP>. We also see evidence of surface compositional variation. <BR /> Conclusions: The low value of YORP predicted by means of thermo-physical analysis, consistent with the results of the light curve study, might be due to the self-limiting properties of rotational YORP, possibly involving movement of sub-surface and surface material. This may also be consistent with the surface compositional variation that we see. The physical model of Cuyo can be used to investigate cohesive forces as a way to explain why some targets survive rotation rates faster than the fission limit. <P />Tables A.1 and A.2 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/627/A172\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/627/A172</A>Based in part on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, under programmes 185.C-1033 and 185.C-1034.", "title": ["Physical model of near-Earth asteroid (1917) Cuyo from ground-based optical and thermal-IR observations\u2605"], "year": "2019"}

{"abstract": "Very small Near-Earth asteroids (diameter less than 200 m), due to their size, can usually be observed for a short time during close approaches to the Earth, after which it is often necessary to wait several or dozens years for another approach. Therefore, not many of these objects are well characterized, for example, only about 1% of them have a designated taxonomic type [1]. Since 2015, we have been conducting campaigns of photometric observations of very small NEAs with a very long observation arc in order to determine their physical properties from a single near-Earth flyby. We determine the rotation periods, colour indices, taxonomic types, absolute brightnesses from the phase curves, effective diameters, and spin axes. So far, we have organized four observation campaigns involving many observatories around the world. We observed 2015 AZ43 in February 2015 [2], 2021 DW1 in March 2021 [3][4][5] and 2022 AB in January 2022.[6][7][8].

Their estimated absolute magnitudes H =23.23 and H=23.80, respectively [9]. The asteroids were discovered on 9 January 2015 by PanSTARRS 1 and on 26 December 2013, respectively [10].

{"abstract": "We present thermal properties and an improved shape model for potentially hazardous asteroid (162421) 2000 ET70. In addition to the radar data from 2000 ET70's apparition in 2012, our model incorporates optical lightcurves and infrared spectra that were not included in the analysis of Naidu et al. (2013, Icarus 226, 323-335). We confirm the general ;clenched fist; appearance of the Naidu et al. model, but compared to their model, our best-fit model is about 10% longer along its long principal axis, nearly identical along the intermediate axis, and about 25% shorter along the short axis. We find the asteroid's dimensions to be 2.9 km \u00d7 2.2 km \u00d7 1.5 km (with relative uncertainties of about 10%, 15%, and 25%, respectively). With the available data, 2000 ET70's period and pole position are degenerate with each other. The radar and lightcurve data together constrain the pole direction to fall along an arc that is about twenty-three degrees long and eight degrees wide. Infrared spectra from the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF) provide an additional constraint on the pole. Thermophysical modeling, using our SHERMAN software, shows that only a subset of the pole directions, about twelve degrees of that arc, are compatible with the infrared data. Using all of the available data, we find that 2000 ET70 has a sidereal rotation period of 8.944 h (\u00b1 0.009 h) and a north pole direction of ecliptic coordinates (52<SUP>\u2218</SUP> , -60<SUP>\u2218</SUP>) \u00b16<SUP>\u2218</SUP> . The infrared data, acquired over several dates, require that the thermal properties (albedo, thermal inertia, surface roughness) must change across the asteroid's surface. By incorporating the detailed shape model and spin state into our thermal modeling, the multiple ground-based observations at different viewing geometries have allowed us to constrain the levels of the variations in the surface properties of this asteroid.", "title": ["Thermal properties and an improved shape model for near-Earth asteroid (162421) 2000 ET70"], "year": "2017"}

{"title": ["Determination of colour indices of super-fast rotator near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2021", "abstract": "1.IntroductionIn recent decades, we have been observing an exponential increase in near-Earth asteroids(NEAs) discoveries especially smaller than 200m(VSAs). According to the Holsapple model and observational data[2], VSAs can rotate much faster than larger asteroids. The reason for this is the monolithic structure as opposed to the larger asteroids made of smaller stones, the so-called rubble pile. VSA holds together mainly due to cohesive forces, not gravity, so many of them have rotational periods shorter than the 2.2h spin limit typical of rubble piles.However, we do not know much about these objects, especially in terms of their taxonomy, which may turn out to be the key to a better understanding of the composition of VSAs, thereby their threats, and a better determination of the rotation limit taking into account the taxonomic type. Only ~1% of these bodies are assigned a taxonomic class[7].2.VSA observation issues and methodsVSAs are faint, with a mid-class telescope(&lt;=2m), they can only be observed during close approaches, when they move quickly on the celestial sphere. This makes observations difficult using the classical methods used for further objects.In our photometric observation, the telescope follows the asteroid keeping the NEA image circular on CCD frame, but the star images extend into long trails. An example of such observations at extremely high speed NEA on the sky was presented at the last year's EPSC(see[4]). Luckily, there was a photometric night then and instrumental measurements were enough to determine the rotation period. In worse conditions and/or when we want to determine the colour indices, we need accurate differential photometry. For this purpose, we use a circular aperture for the asteroid image and a pill aperture[1] for comparison stars images. We raised the issue of the use of the pill aperture in NEA photometry in[5]. Solar analogs from the PanSTARRS catalog were used as comparison stars.An appropriate observation strategy is essential in determining the color indices of newly discovered NEAs. We need to know the rotation period. Many VSAs are superfast rotators(P&lt;2.2h), and our observations of new objects are adapted to effectively detect periods between almost the entire range at relatively high S/N.The general idea is to make 10s exposures for 15min (detection period ~1-15min) followed by 60s exposures for 2h (detection period ~5-120min) and, depending on the observation time, repeat these observation blocks several times. Exposures in these blocks are made with wideband filters.Between these blocks we make a sequence of B,L,V,L,R blocks - each with 60s exposures taken for 15-20min, where L is our broadband filter.Then, by moving the B,V,R lightcurves to the most accurate L lightcurve, one can determine the magnitude shift in relation to the L lightcurve, obtaining L-B,L-V,L-R, hence we get B-V and V-R.We noticed that in the case of rotation periods close to the time of colour exposures, we can assume that each measurement is averaged brightness over the period. Then we determined the brightness in a given filter from the arithmetic mean, and the uncertainty from the standard deviation of the mean. The same can be done when the exposure time is a multiple of the period.To check the impact of the assumption of ideal averaging over period on the results, we run simulations. We assume that the synthetic composite lightcurve obtained from 10-second exposures is the ideal curve. We integrate this synthetic composite lightcurve over the period to get the brightness we would get if the exposure time were equal to the period. Then we integrate the part of the curve corresponding to the color exposure time and repeat this by slightly shifting the phase from which we start to integrate, until we return to the initial phase. In this way, we get all possible values that we can get at a given exposure time. Then we compare the mean result with the value obtained by the integration over the period.3.Observation and resultsWe conducted our observations in search of super-fast rotating VSAs between October 2020 and April 2021. We were able to determine the physical properties of several objects. Most of the observations were made with the 0.7-m RBT/PST2 telescope at the Winer Observatory in Arizona. For 2021 DW1, we organized a larger campaign involving telescopes from around the world. We devoted a separate poster to this object at this conference[6].Below are the results for 2020 UA, which we observed on 20th October 2020. More details and results for the remaining asteroids will be announced at the conference.In Fig.1, we present the composite lightcurve for the best solution of the rotation period P=64.60+/-0.015s and amplitude 0.25mag. Since the time of colour exposures is 93% of the rotation period, we checked whether we can assume that P=texp for the determination of indices. It turned out that the impact was negligible, the average difference between the true average brightness period and our results is 0.0003+/-0.0047mag. The final indices are presented in Fig.2.Fig.1.Composite lightcurve for 2020 UA. We used two 10-s exposure blocks during 15min each. The break between the blocks was 6.5h. Fig.2.Colour-colour plot. The blue point is the result for 2020 UA(brightness in g,r,i obtained using PanSTARRS solar analogs), the uncertainty range is marked with a cross.

{"title": ["Discovery of a Satellite around a Near-Earth Asteroid"], "year": "1997", "abstract": "In the course of the major observational programme of asteroids by the Institute of Planetary Exploration of the German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) [1] in Berlin, two of the staff astronomers, Stefano Mottola and Gerhard Hahn , have discovered a small satellite (moon) orbiting the asteroid (3671) Dionysus. <P />The new measurements were obtained with the DLR CCD Camera attached at the 60-cm Bochum telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile. <P />This is only the second known case of an asteroid with a moon. Moons and planets <P />Until recently, natural satellites were only known around the major planets . The Moon orbits the Earth, there are two tiny moons around Mars, each of the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune has many more, and even the smallest and outermost, Pluto, is accompanied by one [2]. <P />However, the new discovery now strengthens the belief of many astronomers that some, perhaps even a substantial number of the many thousands of minor planets (asteroids) in the solar system may also possess their own moons. The first discovery of a satellite orbiting an asteroid was made by the NASA Galileo spacecraft, whose imagery, obtained during a fly-by of asteroid (253) Ida in August 1993, unveiled a small moon that has since been given the name Dactyl. (3671) Dionysus: an Earth-crossing asteroid <P />In the framework of the DLR asteroid monitoring programme, image sequences are acquired to measure an asteroid's brightness variations caused by the changing amount of sunlight reflected from the asteroid's illuminated surface as it spins, due to its irregular shape. The brightness variations may be used to derive the asteroid's rotational properties, such as speed of rotation and spin axis orientation. <P />Asteroid Dionysus [3] was put on the observing list because it belongs to a special class of asteroids, the members of which occasionally come very close to the Earth and have a small, but non-negligible chance of colliding with our planet. Most of these objects move in highly elliptical orbits that lie partly inside, partly outside that of the Earth. They are accordingly referred to as `Earth-crossing asteroids' or Apollo-type asteroids , after the proto-type of this group, (1862) Apollo, that was discovered in 1932 by Karl Reinmuth in Heidelberg [4]. <P />The orbital characteristics of Dionysus lead to moderately close approaches to the Earth every 13 years, with the one in 1997 being the first since its discovery that is favourable for extensive observations. On July 6, 1997, it passed within 17 million km of our planet. At that time it was visible from the southern hemisphere with a moderately-sized telescope as a relatively fast-moving object. The strange lightcurve of asteroid (3671) Dionysus <P />Caption to ESO PR Photo 20/97 [GIF, 10k] <P />The first observations of the brightness of this asteroid in late May 1997 showed a `normal' two-maxima-two-minima lightcurve (change of brightness with time), typical of rotating non-spherical bodies. The period of rotation was 2.7 hours, i.e., this asteroid spins almost nine times as fast as the Earth. <P />However lightcurves observed on two subsequent nights were strikingly different from the previous ones. In both cases a deeper and shifted dip was seen, indicative of an attenuation - an additional dimming of the sunlight reflected by the asteroid, cf. ESO Press Photo 20/97 . <P />The observers hypothesised that these lightcurve features were due to an eclipse by an unknown object moving in an orbit around (3671) Dionysus , thereby covering part of the illuminated surface of the asteroid at regular time intervals [5]. Fortunately, this hypothesis can be checked, because the phenomenon should then repeat itself periodically. <P />Accordingly, the DLR scientists made a prediction for the next occurences of dips in the lightcurve, based on the time difference between the two observed events. Confirmation of the satellite <P />Contacts were made with observers located at other observatories, in order to secure lightcurve coverage over a longer period of time than was possible from La Silla alone. As a result, a series of lightcurve measurements were performed from June 3 to 9 in close cooperation with Petr Pravec and Lenka Sarounova working at the Ondrejov Observatory, near Prague in the Czech Republic. <P />Luckily, the weather conditions were favourable at both sites and the dips in the lightcurve were indeed observed at the predicted times. <P />Based on the four well observed events, it was then possible to determine a period of 1.155 days for their occurence. Thus, the hypothesis of a satellite orbiting around Dionysus was confirmed. As a result, the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center located in Cambridge (MA, USA) promptly gave a provisional designation to the new satellite - S/1997 (3671) 1 . How big is Dionysus? <P />Meanwhile, in Hawaii, the world's largest infrared telescope was being trained on Dionysus to obtain information about its size and composition. Alan Harris , also a scientist from the DLR in Berlin, and John Davies from the Joint Astronomy Centre in Hilo, Hawaii, observed the thermal infrared radiation emitted by Dionysus with the 3.8-m United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) situated on Mauna Kea. Similar observations over a broader spectral range were also made by the European Space Agency's orbiting Infrared Space Observatory. <P />The thermal or \"heat\" radiation emitted by an asteroid depends on its size and the amount of sunlight it absorbs (darker bodies being warmer). In the case of Dionysus the measured radiation was much weaker than expected, indicating that the asteroid has an intrinsically bright (reflective) surface and is only about 1 km in diameter. This is much smaller than (253) Ida, the only other asteroid known to have a moon, which is about 60 km across. Further observations <P />Eventually it should be possible to determine the orbital radius of the satellite, its size and the inclination of its orbital plane. In order to obtain the data necessary for these determinations, observations will be continued during the present period of good visibility that lasts until September-October 1997. For this reason the discoverers have initiated an international observation campaign devoted to the study of this intriguing object and now involving astronomers from many countries. How common are such satellites? <P />Satellites in orbit around small bodies in the solar system - asteroids and cometary nuclei - have been predicted on theoretical grounds for a long time, even though there is no consensus among planetary scientists about the actual numbers of such systems. <P />Hints about the existence of asteroid satellites also come from the presence of double impact craters on the Moon and other planetary surfaces. This suggests that the projectiles forming these craters were `double' asteroids. Moreover, measurements obtained when an asteroid passes in front of a relatively bright star (a so-called `occultation') have on a few occasions shown features which could be interpreted as due to the presence of a satellite. However, because of the difficult nature of such measurements, it has never been possible to draw unambiguous conclusions. <P />The existence of double asteroids was invoked earlier by Petr Pravec and Gerhard Hahn to explain the unusual features observed in the lightcurves of two other Earth-approaching asteroids 1991 VH and 1994 AW1 . In the case of Dionysus , however, it is possible to predict eclipse events and to confirm them by subsequent measurements. <P />There is therefore mounting evidence that asteroid binary systems might be comparatively common. Observational programmes like the present one by the DLR and Ondrejov groups will help to verify this possibility. Where to find additional information <P />Detailed and up-to-date information about (3671) Dionysus can be found in the Web at the following URL: http://earn.dlr.de/dionysus. Notes: <P />[1] This institute and its parent organisation are known in Germany as Institut fuer Planetenerkundung and Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fuer Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. (DLR) . <P />[2] See ESO Press Release 09/94 of 18 May 1994. <P />[3] Asteroids are small solid planetary bodies revolving around the Sun in orbits that are mostly located in the so-called Main Asteroid Belt, confined between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Most of them are thought to be fragments derived from catastrophic, past collisions between larger asteroids. By mid-1997, the orbits of about 8000 asteroids in the solar system were sufficiently well known to allow them to be officially numbered by the rules of the International Astronomical Union. (3671) Dionysus was discovered in 1984 at the Palomar Observatory (California, USA) and is named after the Greek god of wine. <P />[4] The gravitational influence of the giant planet Jupiter can modify the orbits of asteroids located in particular regions of the Main Belt (the effect is refered to as `orbital perturbations'). As a result, the orbit of an asteroid may `cross' that of a major planet, and eventually it may become a NEO , i.e. a near-Earth object. The orbits of NEO's are highly unstable over times comparable to the age of the solar system. This instability can result in a collision with one of the terrestrial (inner) planets, or with the Sun, or in the ejection of the asteroid out of the solar system. The present orbit of (3671) Dionysus is such that this object is not likely to collide with the Earth in the foreseeable future. <P />[5] The method of analyzing the lightcurve of Dionysus consists of `removing' (subtracting) the normal short-period brightness variations due to rotation of the asteroid and plotting the residuals against time, cf. Press Photo 20/97. The residual lightcurve shows a clear resemblance with typical lightcurves of eclipsing binary stellar systems (in which two stars move around each other, producing mutual eclipses) and leads to a model of two bodies revolving around a common gravitational centre, in an orbital plane containing both the Earth and the Sun.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we investigate planar near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in resonance with the Earth. Integrable approximations for both prograde and retrograde two-body mean motion resonances (MMRs) are introduced in the planar circular restricted three-body problem (CRTBP). A preliminary analysis is implemented in the CRTBP to select candidate planar resonant NEAs. Based on limitations on the inclinations and semimajor axes, 510 candidate resonant NEAs are obtained. We propose a parameter to measure the minimum distance of the trajectory from the collision curve in the CRTBP. The obtained candidate resonant NEAs are further investigated in the ephemeris model, where the gravities of the nine planets are considered and the initial states of the nine planets are obtained from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) database. Encounter times are defined as the time intervals between two successive encounters and are recorded through numerical integration. Among 510 candidate resonant NEAs, 386 Earth-crossing NEAs with encounter times smaller than 10,000 years are analyzed in detail. NEAs with distances from the nearest neighboring resonance below 0.015 au are defined as compact NEAs, while those with distances above 0.015 au are defined as sparse NEAs. Numerical tests indicate that compact NEAs have a weak correlation between the minimum distance to the collision curve and the encounter time, but sparse NEAs, whether with or without other planets' encounters have a strong linear correlation between the minimum distance to the collision curve and the encounter time in a statistical sense. Depending on the value of the minimum distance to the collision curve, Earth-crossing NEAs are classified into resonant and nonresonant NEAs in the CRTBP. Numerical results show that a resonant NEA in the CRTBP is more likely to have a larger encounter time in the ephemeris model than a nonresonant NEA in the CRTBP, especially for sparse NEAs. Finally, three resonant sparse NEAs and three compact NEAs are demonstrated in detail.", "title": ["Planar near-Earth asteroids in resonance with the Earth"], "year": "2019"}

{"abstract": "Collisions among near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are less frequent than those involving pairs of main belt (MB) objects; however, the orbits of many NEAs are partially within the MB. Thus the collisional evolution of NEAs is often dominated by collisions with MB asteroids and, thus, these collisions are not less intense than collisions among MB bodies. In particular, the relative velocity of collisions is usually larger. In this Letter we discuss the dependence of collisional processes of NEAs on their orbital parameters, showing that the collisions are more frequent for low inclinations and for semimajor axes and eccentricities entailing an aphelic distance of about 2.75 au. The collisions may also affect the space-weathering processes: the surface involved in an impact and, eventually, in the re-accumulation of the related ejecta, is somehow refreshed, and the spectral reddening - in particular of the S-complex asteroids - is slowed down. This process may complement the already known refreshing due to close planetary passes. <P />If the process is relevant, an anticorrelation between the visible spectral slope of S-complex NEAs and the estimated intensity of collisional processes should be found.

The radar data consist of echo power spectra and delay-Doppler imaging with 300 m resolution and were obtained using the Arecibo Observatory's 2380 MHz radar. Lightcurve data were gathered using the 0.35 m telescope at the Palmer Divide Station. Using these data, we constructed a detailed shape model of Ivar that reveals more surface detail than earlier models. Ivar was found to have a rotational period of 4.7951689 \u00b1 0.0000026 hours with a pole located within 6\u00b0 of ecliptic longitude and latitude 336\u00b0 and 37\u00b0 respectively. Ivar is an elongated asteroid with maximum extensions along the three body-fixed coordinates being 15.15 \u00d7 6.25 \u00d7 5.66 km \u00b1 10%. The results of surface slope analysis suggest that Ivar is covered with a loose regolith. Ivar appears to reside in, or near, an optimum state with respect to its shape, spin, and bulk density, such that dynamic topography, surface slopes, and erosion rates on the body are near minimum levels and is therefore dynamically stable.", "title": ["Radar and Lightcurve Shape Model of Near-Earth Asteroid (1627) Ivar"], "year": "2017"}
{"abstract": "We studied the motion of medium-sized and small spacecraft orbiting within the binary asteroid systems 175,706 (1996 FG3) and 65,803 Didymos (1996 GT). We have considered spacecraft motion within the binary systems distance regimes between 0.4 and 2.5 km for Didymos and 0.8-4 km for 1996 FG3. Orbital motion of spacecraft, beginning from 20,000 initial conditions lying in the orbital planes of the secondary, were simulated and evaluated for lifespan. <P />The simulations include the effects of (1) the asteroid's mass, shape, and rotational parameters, (2) the secondary's mass and orbit parameters, (3) the spacecraft mass, surface area, and reflectivity (representing large box-wing-shaped medium-sized spacecraft as well as small satellites), and (4) the time of the mission, and therefore the relative position of the system to the sun. <P />Stable orbital motion (i.e., not requiring thrusting maneuvers) was achieved using the Lagrange points L4/L5 and orbital resonances. This allows for long motion arcs, e.g. of 90 days (L4) and 35 days (resonance) in the Didymos system. The accuracy necessary to deploy a probe into L4, so it can remain there for 35 day, is evaluated by comparisons. Retrograde orbits were found assuring 90 days of low eccentric orbiting for a compact small satellite for a great variety of initial conditions. <P />The comparison of simulations at aphelion and perihelion as well as the different spacecraft show the critical impact of solar radiation pressure on orbital stability. 65,803 Didymos (1996 GT) is shown to be more suitable for orbit phases at the close distances we studied compared to 175,706 (1996 FG3). Two possible obliquities of the Didymos system were considered to study the effects of the inclination on perturbing forces at equinox and solstice, showing that cases of low obliquity or times of equinox are beneficial for spacecraft orbiting.", "title": ["Spacecraft orbit lifetime within two binary near-Earth asteroid systems"], "year": "2017"}
{"abstract": "The European component of the joint ESA-NASA Asteroid Impact &amp; Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission has been redesigned from the original version called Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM), and is now called Hera. The main objectives of AIDA are twofold: (1) to perform an asteroid deflection test by means of a kinetic impactor under detailed study at NASA (called DART, for Double Asteroid Redirection Test); and (2) to investigate with Hera the changes in geophysical and dynamical properties of the target binary asteroid after the DART impact. This joint mission will allow extrapolating the results of the kinetic impact to other asteroids and therefore fully validate such asteroid deflection techniques. Hera leverages technology and payload pre-developments of the previous AIM, and focuses on key measurements to validate impact models such as the detailed characterisation of the impact crater. As such, AIDA will be the first documented deflection experiment and binary asteroid investigation. In particular, it will be the first mission to investigate a binary asteroid, and return new scientific knowledge with important implications for our understanding of asteroid formation and solar system history. Hera will investigate the smallest asteroid visited so far therefore providing a unique opportunity to shed light on the role cohesion and Van der Waals forces may play in the formation and resulting internal structure of such small bodies.", "title": ["European component of the AIDA mission to a binary asteroid: Characterization and interpretation of the impact of the DART mission"], "year": "2018"}
{"abstract": "Asteroidal fragments, coming from the main asteroid belt through chaotic dynamical routes, represent the likely source of most meteorites and near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). Many numerical experiments carried out over the past decade point to two specific source locations: the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter near 2.5 AU and the inner edge of the belt near 2.1 AU, where the dynamics is dominated by the g = g<SUB>6</SUB> (or v<SUB>6</SUB> ) secular resonance. We have tried to model and assess in a quantitative way the first part of the meteorite/NEA delivery process, namely the ejection of fragments from cratering and breakup events undergone by the existing asteroids as a consequence of impacts and the chance insertion of the escaping fragments into the \"dangerous\" strips of the phase space close to the resonances. For every parent asteroid, the efficiency of this process depends on several factors: (i) the mass vs ejection velocity distribution of the fragments, (ii) the escape velocity of the parent body, (iii) the \u0394 V required to approach a resonance surface, (iv) the width of the strip surrounding the resonance surfaces where chaotic eccentricity increases are possible, and (v) the amount of ejected material per unit time. The assumed number vs size distribution of asteroids at diameters &lt;30 km is also critical in determining the overall flux. The results show that: (1) a large fraction of meteorites and NEAs could be generated by a small (\u22481%) and possibly nonrepresentative fraction of the known asteroid population, mostly made of relatively large bodies located in the neighborhood of the two resonances; (2) both the 3:1 and the g = g<SUB>6</SUB> resonance are potentially effective channels for fragment collection and delivery, although they sample in a different way the orbital elements and the physical properties (size and taxonomic type) of the parent objects; and (3) the g = g<SUB>6</SUB> resonance is an efficient fragment collector not only near the inner edge of the belt, but also for several moderate-inclination (15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0) asteroids at semimajor axes of about 2.4 and 2.7 AU. As for meteorite origin, within the existing uncertainties our model is consistent with the observed meteoroid flux on the Earth and suggests that a few large and possibly peculiar S-type asteroids and Vesta are the parent bodies of ordinary chondrites and basaltic achondrites, respectively. However, a poor knowledge of several key parameters and a lack of understanding of how a significant fraction of the asteroid fragments are launched at velocities of hundreds of meters per second prevent us from making claims stronger than those for the consistency of our model.", "title": ["The Injection of Asteroid Fragments into Resonances"], "year": "1993"}

An additional 19 earth approachers with sizes in the range 50 m to 5 km were discovered. These obervations determine the cumulative flux of asteroids near earth as a function of absolute magnitude.

In this paper, we focus on a rendezvous mission with 2006 RH<SUB>120</SUB>, an asteroid classified as a Temporarily Captured Orbiter (TCO). TCOs form a new population of near Earth objects presenting many advantages toward that goal. Prior to the mission, we consider the spacecraft hibernating on a Halo orbit around the Earth-Moon's L<SUB>2</SUB> libration point. The objective is to design a transfer for the spacecraft from the parking orbit to rendezvous with 2006 RH<SUB>120</SUB> while minimizing the fuel consumption. Our transfers use indirect methods, based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, combined with continuation techniques and a direct method to address the sensitivity of the initialization.

Arecibo images of 2000 EH26 and 2000 YA place up to four 15-m-resolution pixels on each object and establish lower bounds on their maximum dimensions of about 60 meters. 2000 EH26 has a 13-cm bandwidth of only 0.1 Hz, consistent with a subradar latitude that was close to a pole or with a rotation period that exceeds 1 day if the subradar latitude was nearly equatorial. Arecibo images suggest a 1.3-h upper bound on 2000 YA's rotation period, consistent with the photometrically- derived period obtained by Pravec et al.

{"abstract": "The asteroids that may cross, or approach, the orbit of the terrestrial planets compose the NEAs population. In the present work we studied the effects of close encounters between hypothetical NEAs' binaries and the Earth to determine the limiting stability of their satellites as a function of the encounter conditions. We were able to estimate the frequency of such encounters, thus, the expected lifetime of the NEAs binaries. Through numerical simulations, all the encounters between asteroids and the Earth that were closer than 100 Earth radii were recorded. The next step consisted of simulating a representative sample of those encounters considering the Earth, and the asteroid with a cloud of non-interacting satellites around it. The largest radial distance for which all the satellites survive (no collision or disruption) was defined as the critical radius R<SUB>C</SUB>. We present a statistical analysis of the recorded encounters, and the critical radius given as a function of the impact parameter and of the relative velocity, defining the stable and unstable encounter conditions for the NEAs satellites. In all these simulations and analyses three distinct satellite masses were considered: massless satellites, satellites with ten percent of the asteroid mass, and satellites with the same mass of the asteroid. We found that the close encounters that are able to remove the most internal satellites are quite frequent. For the NEAs of the sample initially belonging to the Atens group, we found that \u224893% of them suffer an encounter with such characteristics within 10 Myr and that 50% of these encounters happen within approximately 330 thousand years.

{"abstract": "Many asteroids in the main asteroid belt may be ice-rich, particularly in the outer Main Belt (OMB). We model temperature and sublimation-driven ice loss for asteroids originating from the OMB, based on ensembles of trajectories from N-body integrations, as they become near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) or evolve onto orbits typical of Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs). We find that the majority of ice loss occurs long before an asteroid reaches a NEA- or JFC-like orbit. The least ice loss occurs at the polar regions of bodies with small axis tilt. The polar regions of these bodies remain so cold that ice does not retreat beyond the influence of the seasonal thermal wave (often less than 5 m) by the time the objects have reached NEA- or JFC-like orbits.", "title": ["Preservation of polar ice on near-Earth asteroids originating in the outer main belt: A model study with dynamical trajectories"], "year": "2020"}

The combined spectrum shows a very flat reflectance spectrum with two weak absorption bands diagnostic of olivine and pyroxene surface chemistry, but with absorption features which appear suppressed compared to typical S-type asteroid spectra. Measurements of the following diagnostic band parameters were taken: Band I at 0.926 \u00b1 0.003 \u03bcm and Band II at 2.07 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcm; Band I depth of 4.5 \u00b1 0.15% and Band II depth of 4.0 \u00b1 0.21%; Band Area Ratio of 1.13 \u00b1 0.05.

This is supported by principal component analysis of the combined visible-NIR spectrum falling on the C/X-complex side of the \u03b1-line. In order to understand the suppressed band features of the VNIR spectra, we investigated effects from phase reddening, space weathering, grain size, and shock darkening. We were able to rule out phase reddening because the NIR observations were at a low phase angle and 1998 OR2's observed spectrum was very flat. Principal component analysis was used to eliminate the hypothesis that space weathering or grain size effects were causing the observed spectral features. Shock darkening is the ideal explanation for the observed spectral features because it causes suppressed absorption band features without reddening the asteroid spectrum. Shock darkening is also supported by principal component analysis placing 1998 OR2 near the end of the shock darkening trend in principal component space, as measured by [1, 5]. We use an areal mixing model with lab measurements of the shock darkened H5 chondrite, Chergach, to constrain the amount of shock darkened material on the asteroid's surface at ~63% dark lithology and ~37% light lithology. <P />References: [1] Binzel R.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present our study of the orbital and thermal evolutions, due to solar radiative heating, of four near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) considered as potential target candidates for sample return space missions to primitive asteroids. We used a dynamical model of the NEA population to estimate the most likely source region and orbital history of these objects. Then, for each asteroid, we integrated numerically over their entire lifetime a set of 14 initially indistinguishable orbit ( clones), obtained by small variations of the nominal initial conditions. Using a thermal model, we then computed surface and sub-surface temperatures of these bodies during their dynamical history. Our aim is to determine whether these bodies are likely to have experienced high temperature level, and whether great temperature changes can be expected due to the orbital changes as well as their maximum and minimum values. Such information is important in the framework of sample return space missions whose goal is to bring back pristine materials. The knowledge of the temperature range of materials at different depth over the orbital evolution of potential targets can help defining sampling strategies that ensure the likelihood that unaltered material will be brought back. Our results suggest that for all the considered potential targets, the surface has experienced for some time temperatures greater than 400 K and at most 500 K with 50% probability. This probability drops rapidly with increasing temperature. Sub-surface materials at a depth of only 3 cm are much more protected from high temperature and generally do not reach temperatures exceeding 450 K (with 50% probability). They should thus be unaltered at this depth at least from a Sun-driven heating point of view. On the other hand, surface material for some of the considered objects can have a range of temperature which can make them less reliable as pristine materials. However, it is assumed here that the same material is constantly exposed to solar heat, while regolith turnover may occur. The latter can be caused by different processes such as seismic shaking and/or impact cratering. This would reduce the total time that materials are exposed to a certain temperature. Thus, it is very likely that a sample collected from any of the four considered targets, or any primitive NEA with similar dynamical properties, will have components that will be thermally unaltered as long as some of it comes from only 3 to 5 cm depth. Such a depth is not considered difficult to reach with some of the current designs of sampling devices.", "title": ["Orbital and thermal evolutions of four potential targets for a sample return space mission to a primitive near-Earth asteroid"], "year": "2010"}

{"abstract": "The Yarkovsky effect describes a differential thermal momentum transfer that affects the orbital trajectories of small asteroids and meteoroids. It differs from solar radiation pressure in the sense that it is caused by the temperature difference generated on the asteroid surface due to solar radiation. The magnitude of the Yarkovsky effect is a function of the mass and thermal characteristics such as absorptivity and emissivity of the asteroid surface. We have focused our research on the artificial enhancement of Yarkovsky thrust for the asteroid Apophis because it concerns the possibility of impacting Earth by 2029, to deflect it from its base trajectory, as the Yarkovsky effect is driven by a temperature gradient on the asteroid surface that creates differential thermal radiation. This differential radiation can be enhanced by employing a spacecraft with a targeted electrostatic spraying mechanism, coupled with a UV radiator that can create a positively charged layer on the target locations of the asteroid surface. Each target location can then act as an electrostatic adhesive for the sprayed nanoparticles (induced with negative charge) such that they stick and alter the surface albedo (refer Figure 1). To further enhance the Yarkovsky effect, UV radiation can be focused on the sprayed target locations as long as the spacecraft is in orbit. Apophis belongs to the class of Chondrite meteors and is in a retrograde orbit around the Sun. Consequently, the enhanced Yarkovsky thrust will alter the orbit trajectory in a controlled manner such that Apophis will steer clear of the Earth. A similar technique may be utilised for other killer asteroids if orbit trajectories are known well in advance. The proposed method is expected to deflect the asteroid from its base trajectory within the stipulated timeframe. The proposed spraying mechanism will enable electrostatic adhesion such that the spray-coated locations will be able to absorb and radiate as per the spin-rate of the asteroid to alter the surface albedo to induce significant changes in its trajectory. The onboard UV radiator will further increase the net radiation being absorbed and radiated by the asteroid surface, hence intensifying the Yarkovsky thrust in the desired direction (refer Figure 2). The paper, in part, discusses how effective thrust enhancement can deflect Apophis such that it misses its approach trajectory towards Earth.", "title": ["Deflection of Near-Earth Asteroids by Altering the Surface Albedo and Increasing the Net Surface Radiation to Intensify the Yarkovsky Effect in Space"], "year": "2021"}

The images span only about 15\u00b0 of sky motion and are not strong, but they place up to twenty 40 m by 160 m pixels on the asteroid and have complete rotational phase coverage. Our analysis establishes that the radar observations are confined to subradar latitudes between -20\u00b0 and -40\u00b0. The echo spectra and optical lightcurves span \u223c80\u00b0 of sky motion, which provides important geometric leverage on the pole direction. The lightcurves are essential for accurate estimation of the asteroid's shape and spin state.

First, the concept and overall design of the NEA surveillance constellation are discussed.

The Sun-Venus libration orbit is taken as the parking orbit, and its stable invariant manifolds are used to reduce the deployment fuel consumption. Next, the detection performance of the CROWN was evaluated considering constraints of apparent visual magnitude and field of view. The NEA orbit determination (OD) using the CROWN was studied and verified. Simulation results show that the CROWN can be deployed with a total velocity increment of approximately 300 m/s.

{"abstract": "2018 LA was an asteroid of few meters in size discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey on 2018 June 2 at 08:15 UT near the opposition at one lunar distance from the Earth. Before the object set below the horizon, the Catalina Sky Survey obtained eleven astrometric observations over one hour and a half that were promptly reported to the Minor Planet Center. Once the astrometry became publicly available, JPL's Scout system identified a 5% probability that 2018 LA could reach the Earth within hours of discovery, from 13:30 UT to 17:15 UT. The impact corridor extended from the Pacific Ocean east of Papua New Guinea to the Atlantic Ocean west of Namibia. The remeasurement of the initial astrometry and the report of a twelfth detection by the Catalina Sky Survey increased the impact probability to 30%. Because of the short observation arc and the proximity of 2018 LA to the Earth, the plane-of-sky uncertainties were large and so no targeted additional observations were made before 2018 LA actually reached the Earth around 16:45 UT. Within a few hours of the impact, the event was confirmed by independent sources. First, eyewitnesses reported a fireball sighting to the American Meteoritic Society. Moreover, before knowing that the impact had taken place, we searched the images of the ATLAS survey and found two astrometric detections obtained at about 12 UT. Because clouds prevented ATLAS from obtaining its usual four images (and automatically flagging 2018 LA as a candidate NEO), these two detections had to be manually extracted based on the asteroid's expected plane-of-sky location. The ATLAS astrometry confirmed that the impact must have taken place between 16:30 UT and 17:00 UT, with an impact footprint extending from Mozambique to the Atlantic Ocean off the western coast of Namibia. Finally, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization's I47 station in South Africa detected a strong infrasound signal of a bolide over Botswana.

{"abstract": "The Yarkovsky effect is a thermal process acting upon the orbits of small celestial bodies, which can cause these orbits to slowly expand or contract with time. The effect is subtle (da/dt ~ 10^-4 au/My for a 1 km diameter object) and is thus generally difficult to measure. We analyzed both optical and radar astrometry for 600 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) for the purpose of detecting and quantifying the Yarkovsky effect. We present 247 NEAs with measured drift rates, which is the largest published set of Yarkovsky detections. This large sample size provides an opportunity to examine the Yarkovsky effect in a statistical manner. In particular, we describe two independent population-based tests that verify the measurement of Yarkovsky orbital drift. First, we provide observational confirmation for the Yarkovsky effect's theoretical size dependence of 1/D, where D is diameter. Second, we find that the observed ratio of negative to positive drift rates in our sample is 2.34, which, accounting for bias and sampling uncertainty, implies an actual ratio of $2.7^{+0.3}_{-0.7}$. This ratio has a vanishingly small probability of occurring due to chance or statistical noise. The observed ratio of retrograde to prograde rotators is two times lower than the ratio expected from numerical predictions from NEA population studies and traditional assumptions about the sense of rotation of NEAs originating from various main belt escape routes. We also examine the efficiency with which solar energy is converted into orbital energy and find a median efficiency in our sample of 12%.

{"abstract": "Radar speckle tracking is an observational technique to constrain the spin state of a target object.

By tracking the motion of a radar speckle pattern between two or more receiving stations, we can constrain the spin state of the target.First applied to measure the spin state of Mercury, since 2008 radar speckle tracking has become one of the standard techniques for radar observations of near-Earth asteroids. We transmit with either of the Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radars, receive with elements of the Very Long Baseline Array or of the Very Large Array, and measure the time lags between the speckle pattern as seen by each station.

This made it an excellent target for physical characterization.In our campaign, we used 9 telescopes with apertures ranging from 0.3-m to 1.2-m, located in the USA, UK, Spain, Italy, Poland, Ukraine, and South Korea. This gave us a good coverage of the asteroid path. We collected a lot of data which are now being analysed.

In order to search for parent bodies of meteoroid streams, the asteroid groups, including Atira, Apollo, Amor and Aten, have been investigated. Currently, it is considered that surface of asteroids with elongated orbit is exposed to temperature fall: in perihelion it is heated and in aphelion it is cooled. At small orbital periods around the Sun (about 2-4 years) this may lead to formation of meteoroid clusters. On the basis of comparative analysis of orbit, size and chemical and mineralogical composition of NEAs, it is found that asteroids from Apollo group are most likely to be parent bodies of the studied meteoroid streams.", "title": ["Genetic analysis of parameters of near earth asteroids for determining parent bodies of meteoroid streams"], "year": "2018"}

{"abstract": "Autonomous capabilities could be an essential aspect of future near-Earth asteroid exploration missions, enabling a fleet of low-cost spacecraft to be distributed to various targets for increased scientific and engineering returns. This paper studies the design of an adaptive offline policy for a surface imaging task under the influence of maneuver noise via reinforcement learning (RL). An adaptive policy that responds to the changes in the environment is obtained by including asteroid parameters as part of the feedback state and randomizing them during the training. The proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to train the policy. The robustness of the policy is tested in an environment that has unmodeled dynamical effects. Further, the overall performance of the autonomous exploration scheme is studied by combining the RL-based policy with the previously proposed autonomous navigation strategy that is built around optical and [Formula: see text] measurements. The end-to-end simulations that combine both onboard navigation and guidance are performed using asteroid Bennu as an example target, and the results show that the proposed scheme is robust.", "title": ["Autonomous Reconnaissance Trajectory Guidance at Small Near-Earth Asteroids via Reinforcement Learning"], "year": "2023"}
{"abstract": "Photometry of near-Earth asteroid 1995 HM obtained in 1995 June is reported. This object has dimensions of at most a few hundred metres. The 85 observations result in a lightcurve with an amplitude of at least two magnitudes, indicating a highly elongated shape. The full drop in brightness occurred within 15 min, and the cyclicity of the lightcurve indicates that the rotation period of 1995 HM is only about 97 min, the briefest ever determined for an asteroid. If 1995 HM is indeed spinning this quickly then it must be a monolithic body rotating under tension, because the density required for an object with zero tensile strength to maintain integrity through self-gravitation at such a rotation rate is unreasonably high (\u22484 g cm <SUP>-3</SUP> for a spherical profile, and above 8 g cm <SUP>-3</SUP> for the elongation indicated by the observed lightcurve amplitude). The search for an asteroid with such a spin rate has been a long-term quest (Harris (1996) Lunar Planet. Sci.XXVII, 493-494). Some difficulties in fitting a single lightcurve over the full 15 day time-span of the observations may be indicative of this asteroid being in a tumbling state, rather than undergoing simple principal axis rotation.", "title": ["Near-Earth asteroid 1995 HM : a highly-elongated monolith rotating under tension?"], "year": "1997"}
{"abstract": "Radar observations of near-Earth asteroids have revealed a heterogeneous population with diameters spanning meter to kilometer scales, diverse shapes ranging from simple spheroids to extremely irregular bodies, and rotation periods stretching from minutes to weeks. Since 1998, when the Arecibo Observatory S-band radar system was upgraded to transmit up to 1 MW, over 300 near-Earth asteroids have been observed. Thane et al. (2012; AAS 219, #432.14) examined those asteroids observed through 2010 that were well resolved at high power (above 600 kW output) and observed on multiple days allowing for unambiguous basic shape determination and found that the population was rather evenly distributed among spheroids, elongated bars, double-lobed contact binaries, multiple-asteroid systems, and irregularly shaped asteroids. This seems to imply that there is no dominant process of near-Earth asteroid evolution funneling the population to a general shape. Furthermore, there was no clear correlation between size and shape. We will expand the Thane et al. shape distribution to include objects observed from 2011-2012.

{"abstract": "The orbit solution of near-Earth asteroids heavily relies on ground-based optical observations. The orbit uncertainty is limited by the insufficient observation quantity and quality. The Chinese Tianwen-2 mission targets a near-Earth asteroid (469219) Kamo'oalewa and a main-belt comet, 311P/PANSTARRS. To accurately determine the orbit of Kamo'oalewa, more optical observations are needed. Autonomous observation experiments focusing on Kamo'oalewa were carried out using the 2.16-m telescope at the Xinglong Observatory of the National Astronomical Observatory of China. We found that this telescope could observe near-Earth asteroids as faint as a magnitude of 22.8. Based on the stacking method and trailed star extraction algorithm, 14 optical observations were obtained from 2022 to 2024. The orbit for Kamo'oalewa was determined by combining our observations with historical observations between 2004 and 2024. The inclusion of our observations results in improved orbital uncertainties of Kamo'oalewa by 18.67, 7.93, and 11.12 km (1\u03c3) in the X, Y, and Z directions, respectively. Furthermore, by combining all existing and simulated observations, the uncertainty of the orbital determination of Kamo'oalewa was analysed.

{"title": ["Physical characterization of equal-mass binary near-Earth asteroid 2017 YE5: a possible dormant Jupiter-family comet"], "year": "2021", "abstract": "The identification of binary systems among the near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) has grown considerably in recent years, mainly due to detections made by radar observations and to the increase in the number of photometric lightcurves. It is estimated that about 15% of the NEAs population large than 0.3 km are to be binaries, while other 15% can be contact binaries (Pravec et al. 2006; Margot et al. 2015). Most of these binaries consist of one larger primary component and a small secondary component (or satellite), with the primaries having almost spherical shapes and fast rotations. On the other hand, less than 1% of the binary asteroids discovered among the NEA population have components of almost equal size, such as (69230) Hermes, (190166) 2005 UP156, 1994 CJ1 and 2017 YE5. Here, we report a complete physical characterization of the 2017 YE5 system. Observations and data reductionPhotometric lightcurve observations of the nearly equal-mass binary near-Earth asteroid 2017 YE5 were carried out at the Observat\u00f3rio Astron\u00f4mico do Sert\u00e3o de Itaparica (OASI, Brazil) and the Blue Mountains Observatory (BMO, Australia) between July and August 2018. Additionally, using the Observatorio Astron\u00f3mico Nacional de San Pedro M\u00e1rtir (OAN-SPM, Mexico), we observed 2017 YE5 system using photometry with four different broadband filters (BVRI Johnson-Cousins filters) to obtain its photometric spectrum and color indices. Data reduction was performed using the MaxIm DL software following the standard procedures of flat-field correction and sky subtraction. To generate the lightcurves, we obtained the reduced magnitude, i.e., the corrected magnitude to a unity distance by applying -5 log(r\u0394) to the observed magnitudes with r and \u0394 being, respectively, the asteroid's distances from the Sun and from the Earth in AU. To investigate binary periods we used the \"Dual Period Search\" tool in MPO Canopus software which is based on the method described by Pravec and collaborators (Pravec et al. 2006). To obtain the color indices and the photometric spectrum of 2017 YE5, we used standard field stars to calculate the zero-point of the night and, consequently, the calibrated magnitude of the asteroid. Thus, the photometric spectrum was derived from the observed color indices minus the solar color indices and transfomed to normalized reflectance at the V filter. ResultsWe found that 2017 YE5 system has a mutual orbital period of Porb = 23.7 \u00b1 0.01 h and a secondary short period of P2 = 14.88 \u00b1 0.02 h, indicating a possible asynchronous component or non-principal axis rotator in this system (Monteiro et al., submitted). These results are in good agreement with those reported by radar observations (Taylor et al. 2018, 2019). Our result for the orbital period of the binary system is shown in the Figure below. We derived the mean density of 2017 YE5 is from 0.6 to 1.2 g/cm3, implying a rubble-pile internal structure for the components.We found that the color indices determined for 2017 YE5 from OAN-SPM data indicate a very red surface, falling among the D-type asteroids and JFCs in the color-color diagram (V-R vs. V-I) shown in the Figure below. This is in line with the high spectral slope observed in the photometric spectrum of 2017 YE5, which was classified as D-type (Monteiro et al., submitted). Infrared data obtained at the NASA's IRTF, made available by the MIT-Hawaii Near-Earth Object Survey (MITHNEOS), exhibited a thermal emission in the 2.5 \u03bcm range for which we adjusted a low albedo of 2-4% by applying a thermal model (Rivkin et al. 2005). Figure below shows the original infrared spectrum of 2017 YE5 displaying a thermal emission at long wavelengths in the 2.5 \u03bcm range and also shows the corrected spectrum after removal of the thermal tail. In addition, we classified the thermally corrected spectrum of 2017 YE5 as a D-type asteroid in the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy. All results presented in this section were recently submitted (Monteiro et al., submitted). ConclusionsOur physical characterization of this binary system sheds light on its physical properties, including rotational and orbital period, albedo and taxonomic type. We suggest that 2017 YE5 has a cometary origin, due to its comet-like albedo and orbit (TJ = 2.87). It is important to mention that, while suggesting that 2017 YE5 is a dormant Jupiter-family binary comet, we do not reject that it came from the outer main-belt.

Resolutions as fine as 15 m in range revealed a ~7 km diameter object with a wealth of topography: prominent facets, crater-like features that are few tens to more than a thousand meters in diameter, and a triangular feature that sticks out from an overall rounded pole-on silhouette. Pravec et al. (2005) reported lightcurves obtained from July 3 to 21, 1999. Benner et al.

{"abstract": "The near-Earth asteroid thermal model (NEATM) has proven to be a reliable simple thermal model for radiometric diameter determination. However, NEATM assumes zero thermal emission on the night side of an asteroid. We investigate how this assumption affects the best-fitting beaming parameter \u03b7, overestimates the effective diameter D<SUB>eff</SUB> and underestimates the albedo p<SUB>v</SUB> at large phase angles, by testing NEATM on thermal infrared fluxes generated from simulated asteroid surfaces with different thermal inertia \u0393. We compare NEATM to radar diameters and find that NEATM overestimates the diameter when \u03b7 is fitted to multiwavelength observations and underestimates the diameter when default \u03b7 is used. The night emission simulated thermal model (NESTM) is introduced. NESTM models the night side temperature (T<SUB>night</SUB>) as an iso-latitudinal fraction (f) of the maximum day side temperature (T<SUB>max</SUB> calculated for NEATM with \u03b7 = 1): T<SUB>night</SUB> = fT<SUB>max</SUB> cos<SUP>1/4</SUP> \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the latitude. A range of f is found for different thermal parameters, which depend on \u0393. NESTM diameters are compared with NEATM and radar diameters, and it is shown that NESTM may reduce the systematic bias in overestimating diameters. It is suggested that a version of the NESTM which assumes \u0393 = 200Jm<SUP>-2</SUP>s<SUP>-1/2</SUP>K<SUP>-1</SUP> is adopted as a default model when the solar phase angle is greater than 45\u00b0.", "title": ["Investigation of systematic bias in radiometric diameter determination of near-Earth asteroids: the night emission simulated thermal model (NESTM)"], "year": "2009"}

Our sample includes four binaries, one triple system, nine contact binaries and three spheroidal (non-binary) objects. The other objects are irregular shapes, or not yet determined. We have developed a shape-based thermophysical model, SHERMAN, which will take the asteroids' shape and spin into account when calculating the thermal emission.

{"abstract": "Space missions and thermal infrared observations have shown that small asteroids (kilometre-sized or smaller) are covered by a layer of centimetre-sized or smaller particles, which constitute the regolith. Regolith generation has traditionally been attributed to the fall back of impact ejecta and by the break-up of boulders by micrometeoroid impact. Laboratory experiments and impact models, however, show that crater ejecta velocities are typically greater than several tens of centimetres per second, which corresponds to the gravitational escape velocity of kilometre-sized asteroids. Therefore, impact debris cannot be the main source of regolith on small asteroids. Here we report that thermal fatigue, a mechanism of rock weathering and fragmentation with no subsequent ejection, is the dominant process governing regolith generation on small asteroids. We find that thermal fragmentation induced by the diurnal temperature variations breaks up rocks larger than a few centimetres more quickly than do micrometeoroid impacts. Because thermal fragmentation is independent of asteroid size, this process can also contribute to regolith production on larger asteroids. Production of fresh regolith originating in thermal fatigue fragmentation may be an important process for the rejuvenation of the surfaces of near-Earth asteroids, and may explain the observed lack of low-perihelion, carbonaceous, near-Earth asteroids.", "title": ["Thermal fatigue as the origin of regolith on small asteroids"], "year": "2014"}

{"abstract": "Boulders are seen on spacecraft images of near-Earth asteroids Eros and Itokawa. Radar images often show bright pixels or groups of pixels that travel consistently across the surface as the object rotates, which may be indicative of similar boulders on other near-Earth asteroids. Examples of these bright pixels were found on radar observations of 2005 YU55 and 2006 VV2 (Benner et al. 2014). Nolan et al. (2013) also identify one large possible boulder on the surface of Bennu, target of the OSIRIS-REx sample return mission. We explore the detectability of boulders by adding synthetic features on asteroid models, and then simulating radar images. These synthetic features were added using BLENDER ver. 2.70, a free open-source 3-D animation suite. Starting with the shape model for Bennu (diameter ~500 m), spherical 'boulders' of 10 m, 20 m, and 40 m diameter were placed at latitudes between 0 and 90 deg. Simulated radar observations of these models indicated that spherical boulders smaller than 10 m may not be visible in observations but that larger ones should be readily seen. Boulders near the sub-Earth point can be hidden in the bright region near the leading edge, but as the asteroid's rotation moves them towards the terminator, they become visible again, with no significant dependence on the latitude of the boulder. These simulations suggest that we should detect large boulders under most circumstances in high-quality radar images, and we have a good estimate of the occurrence of such features on near-Earth objects. Results of these simulations will be presented.", "title": ["Detectability of Boulders on Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2014"}
{"abstract": "Computed orbital elements of asteroids contain errors depending on the errors of observations. In accordance with the procedure described by Sitarski (1998) we can find randomly selected sets of orbital elements which reasonably represent all observations with fixed mean rms residual. In this way we can obtain the error ellipse of the initial orbital elements, and that of the predicted ones. By integrating equations of motion of these computed clones we can obtain a time evolution of changes of the shape of the torus, inside which all the orbits of the clones exist. The time evolution of the configuration of the torus and its size are connected with the asteroid position inside this torus. The larger is the torus the more difficult it is to find the position of the asteroid. The shape of the torus and its time evolution depend mainly on the kind of the asteroid's orbit. If the orbit is more chaotic, then changes of the torus shape are more rapid and the size of the torus is larger. <P />Close approaches of asteroids to planets are the main source of the chaotic motion. This is particularly important in computing their close approaches to Earth. The distances between the minor planet on the nominal orbit and the virtual minor planets around the nominal orbit can attain considerable values. In this work we computed the time necessary for the values of the mean distances of the clones to achieve the dimensions of the Earth radius. In this respect, we investigated the motion of the known earlier asteroids 433 Eros and 1943 Anteros, and the recently discovered minor planets 99942 Apophis (2004 MN4) and 2004 VD17 - the most dangerous to the Earth, according to the Impact Risk Page of NASA (http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/). <P />It appears that time-span after which dimensions of the torus attain well defined values are strongly correlated with the stability time and they are also connected with frequent and close approaches to the planets. Furthermore, it was investigated whether the computed orbital elements of the asteroids for the epoch of the beginning, middle or end of the observation, influence the behavior of the asteroids. Also the propagation of the region of uncertainty of asteroid position was computed. This can simplify the computing of close approaches of these asteroids to the Earth and the impact risk assessment.", "title": ["Error Propagation of the Computed Orbital Elements of Selected Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2007"}
{"title": ["Near Earth Asteroid redirect missions based on gravity assist maneuver"], "year": "2014", "abstract": "During last years several events attracted world community attention to the hazards of hitting the Earth by sky objects. One of these objects is Apophis asteroid what was expected with nonzero probability to hit the Earth in 2036. Luckily after more precise measurements this event is considered as practically improbable. But the other object has really reached the Earth, entered the atmosphere in the Chelyabinsk area and caused vast damages. After this the hazardous near Earth objects problem received practical confirmation of the necessity to find the methods of its resolution. The methods to prevent collision of the dangerous sky object with the Earth proposed up to now look not practical enough if one mentions such as gravitational tractor or changing the reflectivity of the asteroid surface. Even the method supposing the targeting of the spacecraft to the hazardous object in order to deflect it from initial trajectory by impact does not work because its low mass as compared with the mass of asteroid to be deflected. For example the mass of the Apophis is estimated to be about 40 million tons but the spacecraft which can be launched to intercept the asteroid using contemporary launchers has the mass not more than 5 tons. So the question arises where to find the heavier projectile which is possible to direct to the dangerous object? The answer proposed in our paper is very simple: to search it among small near Earth asteroids. As small ones we suppose those which have the cross section size not more than 12-15 meters and mass not exceeding 1500 -1700 tons. According to contemporary estimates the number of such asteroids is not less than 100000. The other question is how to redirect such asteroid to the dangerous one. In the paper the possibilities are studied to use for that purpose gravity assist maneuvers near Earth. It is shown that even among asteroids included in contemporary catalogue there are the ones which could be directed to the trajectory of the gravity assist maneuver near Earth resulted by following impact with dangerous asteroid. As example of the last one the Apophis was chosen. The required delta-V pulse to be applied to the candidate projectile asteroid to fulfill mentioned change of initial trajectory was confirmed to be comparatively small: not exceeding 10 m/s, and the smallest is about 2 m/s. To fulfilled this maneuver it is necessary to land and to mount on the surface of the asteroid projectile the spacecraft with sufficient amount of propellant onboard. The possible trajectories and demanded maneuvers were explored and it was confirmed that for contemporary space technology it is doable for the small asteroids belonging to the determined by our studies list of candidates supposing some reservations, namely the mass of the found asteroids. This was not considered as decisive obstacle because up to now only about 1% of small enough asteroids are included in catalogue so the list of the appropriate ones is far from to be closed. The studies have been fulfilled aimed to develop the methods to reached required accuracies of asteroid projectile trajectory parameters determination. With existing methods used for the usual spacecraft the limits of achievable accuracies demand the corrections delta-V maneuvers which may exceed the nominal ones. As a result the proposed conception of hazardous asteroids deflection becomes problematic. To overcome this obstacle in the paper new method of trajectory parameters determination is proposed and explored. Practically it is radio interferometer method when one transponder is placed on the asteroid target and two others together with the asteroid projectile form tetrahedron. This system begins to operate in vicinity of target asteroid in autonomous regime and expected to allow reaching the demanded low enough correction maneuver values. Paper gives the estimations of the accuracy of these three bodies relative motion parameters and expected limit values of correction maneuvers needed for hitting the target object. As additional option of planetary defense system construction the idea to redirect small near Earth asteroids onto the orbits resonance with the Earth orbit is explored. It is shown that it is possible to reach it by the use gravity assist maneuvers as it was described above by applying small velocity impulses to the asteroids. At least 11 asteroids were found demanded small enough delta-V for transferring them on such trajectories. After executing these maneuvers one can receive the system of asteroids approaching to the Earth practically each month with a possibility to use them as projectiles or for the purposes of delivering to the Earth their soil samples."}
{"abstract": "The class of Near-Earth Asteroids known as Atens are very important search targets for two reasons: first, recent studies have shown that they have the highest intrinsic frequency of close encounters with the Earth, and second, they are probably undersampled in the known NEA population, as searches have always concentrated toward the opposition region. In order to remove this bias, we outline a few search strategies to increase their discovery rate with the available equipment, before an all-sky survey up to magnitude 22 is implemented (the Spaceguard Survey). Searches should concentrate on two regions located between 50\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 of elongation from the Sun.

{"abstract": "We report on progress to use a radio interferometer, the NRAO Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), to image near Earth asteroids as they are illuminated by the Arecibo Observatory's S-band radar. By measuring the plane-of-sky brightness distribution of the target under the radar's illumination, this method will be able to provide direct, unambiguous spatial resolution of order 100 m which for many objects is sufficient to grossly define their shape, map large scale reflectivity variations, and measure the absolute orientation of the projected spin axis. With receiving antenna spacings of several thousands of kilometers, the potential resolution obtainable with the VLBA at the Arecibo wavelength of 13 cm is on the order of a few milli-arcseconds; several orders of magnitude smaller than typical ground-based telescopic observations. In addition, astrometry of these quickly moving objects at this milli-arcsecond level can greatly reduce orbit uncertainties. <P />This technique has been used to observe two near Earth asteroids, 2000 EW70 and 2002 NY40, during their recent close passes to Earth. The first asteroid was clearly detected; however, a useful correlation on either object is still in progress. A major limitation is the configuration of the hardware correlator which doesn't allow adequate frequency resolution and complicates incorporating a model of the near-field geometry. A solution to these difficulties is now available as a specialized computer interface designed to transfer the raw data into a portable format thereby bypassing the correlator and allowing for a more flexible correlation in software on another platform.

{"abstract": "Hill's approximation models the motion of two small masses gravitationally interacting with each other and perturbed by a large central body. An application of the model is employed in this paper to manoeuvre the relative motion of two asteroids by a small impulse to capture them in bound binary motion in Earth's orbit. The initial conditions prior to the capture manoeuvre are restricted in a parameter space termed the gateway region. The gateway region is produced by applying the constraint that the capture impulse is a real-valued function, and the zero-velocity curve closes, enveloping both asteroids. A full mission scenario is designed with three impulses. The first impulse transfers one asteroid from a far field region to the gateway region, where there is mutual interaction with the second asteroid, which is assumed to be the origin of the relative motion. The second impulse changes the trajectory of the asteroid in the gateway region to a linear drift approaching the second asteroid. The third impulse is calculated by means of increasing the Jacobi integral to reach the critical value required to close the zero-velocity curve. It is demonstrated in principle that the triple impulses enable the candidate asteroids to be captured in a bound pair in Earth's orbit. It is also shown that the thruster on-time for the capture impulse as applied for the different small asteroids considered is short relative to the natural time-scale of the orbital dynamics of the problem, which shows the feasibility of the impulse approximation with the typical thruster forces applied. This strategy could provide a basis for parking small captured near-Earth asteroids in Earth's orbit.", "title": ["The capture of small near-Earth asteroids in a bound binary pair in Earth's orbit"], "year": "2024"}

{"abstract": "Over 40 near-Earth asteroids are now known to have satellites. Delay-Doppler radar imaging has identified the majority of these systems, including both known triple NEAs. Roughly one-sixth of NEAs larger than ~200 m in diameter have satellites; this fraction rises to two-thirds for rapidly rotating large NEAs with spin periods between 2 and 3.5 hours. This distribution is consistent with many NEAs being rubble-pile objects that are disrupted by YORP radiation-pressure spin-up. The observed volume and inferred mass ratios for NEA satellites vary widely, from about 1:1 for the nearly-equal-mass binary 69230 Hermes to 1:1000 or more for objects like 1862 Apollo. The smallest known satellite of any near-Earth asteroid is that of 2004 DC, which has a satellite that is ~60 m in diameter. We have studied archival radar observations to place limits on the occurrence of still smaller satellites. Nearly 60 NEAs with diameters &gt;200 m and spin periods &lt;3.5 hours have been imaged by the Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radars. Again, roughly two-thirds of these objects have satellites 60 m or more in diameter. For 14 objects, we would have been able to detect satellites as small as or smaller than 50 m had they been present, assuming a satellite spin period of &gt;2 hours and setting an SNR threshold of &gt;5/delay-Doppler pixel. For 10 objects, our detection limit was &lt;15 m. For 3 objects, it was &lt;5 m. We do not exclude small satellites entirely, but the fraction of large fast-spinning NEAs with satellites 15 - 50 m in diameter is conservatively &lt;15%, many times less than the fraction with larger satellites. While rotational fission is the probable source of the NEA satellites, the details of satellite formation are not well understood. There are two proposed processes for producing satellites on stable orbits around their primaries. First, the primary may experience several small fission events, and the material in orbit accumulate into a single large satellite. Second, the primary may shed a large mass of material, producing an unstable satellite that rapidly splits, leaving a large satellite in orbit while some material escapes the system entirely or is re-accreted. The apparent lower size limit of roughly 50 m for NEA satellites has implications for both of these satellite formation models and for asteroid internal structures. Either even the smallest fission events shed enough material to create ~50 m satellites immediately, or small fission events must happen in rapid sequence so that few-decameter satellites are so rare that none have yet been observed. The lower size limit may also represent a cohesive limit for satellites that form on unstable orbits. If a satellite has too much cohesion, it cannot undergo a secondary fission that would leave a portion of its mass on a stable orbit.", "title": ["A Lower Size Limit for Near-Earth Asteroid Satellites"], "year": "2013"}

The impact makes us informed definitely that the earth is faced with the small but serious threat of Near Earth Objects (NEOs). Chinese scientists of Purple Mountain Observatory proposed a plan of Chinese Near Earth Object Survey (CNEOS) in the conference on NEOs held in the building of the World Headquarters of United Nations, New York in 1995. This project started in 1998. During the past 7 years, CNEOS proceeded in selecting observational site, manufacturing telescope and CCD detector, carrying out observation, reducing mass data, and assessing impact risk from NEOs. Will those so-called potential hazardous asteroids be the terminator of mankind? In 2007, NASA proposed the Spaceguard goal to detect, track, catalogue and characterize 90% of the potentially hazardous objects with diameters greater than 140 m. This dissertation reviews the current situation of research on asteroids and NEOs, which will greatly enhance our understanding of the planetary sciences. The project of CNEOS, including selecting observational site, manufacturing telescope and CCD detector, had been put in practice since 1998. The telescope of CNEOS is a 1.04/1.20/1.80 m Schmidt telescope, equipped with a 4096 by 4096 CCD detector which has drift-scanning function. In this dissertation, the advantage and disadvantage of drift-scanning and corresponding observational method are discussed.

This dissertation also develops algorithms of pretreatment of astronomical image, extracting objects, and cross-identification, then discusses the methods of identifying and classifying of move objects, establishes software to realize the reduction of the mass data. Until November 2007, CNEOS had found 332 new asteroids including an Apollo type NEO and a Jupiter-family periodic comet. The observation quantity of CNEOS ranked the eighth among all 378 asteroid observation plans, and the accuracy of positional reduction was also quite well. <P />The dissertation carries out the research of dynamics of asteroids.

These spacecraft act together as a 'pitcher' spacecraft and 'catcher' spacecraft, where the pitcher spacecraft hops from asteroid to asteroid and deflects them towards an orbit in the vicinity of Earth, while the catcher spacecraft is stationed at the Earth and captures the incoming asteroids. This novel two-spacecraft strategy is compared to a conventional one-spacecraft strategy using three analyses; a preliminary analysis using coplanar and circular orbits to define the problem, a statistical analysis using fictional near-Earth asteroids to obtain a large set of data, and an analysis where real near-Earth asteroids are used as mission targets. A mass model is developed to compute the retrieved asteroid mass per unit of initial wet spacecraft mass for missions aiming to retrieve multiple asteroids.

To minimize our noise equivalent power, NEP, we carefully designed and selected the receiver components. The receiver circuit uses leading-edge detection of the laser backscatter. Our detector circuit is an enhanced-silicon APD hybrid using a video amplifier, an integrating Bessel filter, and a high- speed programmable threshold comparator. We accomplish time-of-flight (TOF) measurements digitally with an APL-designed GaAs application-specific integrated circuit. A radiation-hardened FORTH microprocessor controls range gating, data collection and formatting, and operational modes. Implementation of control and data communications between the spacecraft and rangefinder uses the MIL-STD 1553-bus architecture. Functional testing and calibration indicate exceptional performance; return power levels were reliably detected over several thresholds with 71-dB attenuation, while observed range jitter was equivalent to the resolution determined by the TOF GaAs chip (31.5 cm).

{"abstract": "In the last three years we have carried out numerical and semi-analytical studies on the secular dynamical mechanisms in the region (semimajor axis a &lt; 2 AU) where the NEA orbits evolve. Our numerical integrations (over a time span of a few Myr) have shown that: (i) the linear secular resonances with both the inner and the outer planets may play an important role in the dynamical evolution of NEAs; (ii) the apsidal secular resonance with Mars could provide an important dynamical transport mechanism by which asteroids in the Mars-crossing region eventually achieve Earth-crossing orbits; (iii) in this region, due to the interaction with the terrestrial planets, the Kozai resonance can occur at small inclinations, with the argument of perihelion \u03c9 librating around 0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0, providing a temporary protection mechanism against close approaches to the planets. The location of the linear secular resonances in this zone has also been obtained by an automatic procedure using a semi-numerical method valid for all values of the inclinations and eccentricities of the small bodies, and also in the case of libration of the argument of perihelion. A map of the secular resonances in the (a, i) plane shows \u2014 in agreement with the numerical integrations \u2014 that all the resonances with the terrestrial and giant planets are present, and also that some of them overlap. Thus the way is now open to fully take into account secular resonances in modelling the dynamical evolution of NEAs.", "title": ["Secular Dynamics of Asteroids in the Inner Solar System"], "year": "1997"}

{"abstract": "The distribution of near-Earth asteroid (NEA) rotation rates differs considerably from the similar distribution of Main Belt asteroids (MBAs) by the presence of excesses of fast and slow rotators, which are not observed or not so prominent in the distribution for MBAs. Among possible reasons for the difference, there can be influence of solar radiation on spin rate of small NEAs, the so-called \"YORP effect,\" which appears due to reflection, absorption, and IR re-emission of the sunlight by an irregularly shaped rotating asteroid. It is known that the YORP-effect action strongly depends on the amount of solar energy obtained by the body (insolation), its size, and albedo. The analysis of observation data has shown that: (1) the mean diameter of NEAs decreases from the middle of the distribution to its ends, that is, the excesses of slow rotators (\u03c9 \u2264 2 rev day<SUP>-1</SUP>) and fast rotators (\u03c9 \u2265 8 rev day<SUP>-1</SUP>) are composed of smaller NEAs than in the middle of the distribution; (2) NEAs of both excesses are in the orbits where their insolation is about 8-10% larger than that of NEAs in the middle of the distribution; and (3) the objects in both excesses have a little lower albedo on average than that of objects in the middle of the distribution. All these results qualitatively agree well with the YORP-effect action and may be considered as independent arguments in favor of it.", "title": ["Influence of the YORP effect on rotation rates of near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2014"}

Preliminary estimates of the diameters, based on visible range extents in the delay-Doppler images, are 300 m for the primary and 60 m for the secondary. The motion of the secondary in the delay-Doppler images suggests an orbital period of roughly 23 hours and a maximum primary-to-secondary separation of at least 0.6 km. The bandwidth of the primary increases from May 29 to June 3, then decreases until the end of observations on June 6, implying 2004 DC was viewed closest to equatorial on June 3. Assuming an equatorial view, the bandwidth suggests a rotation period of about 2 hours, which is in agreement with lightcurve observations [R. Behrend, pers. comm.]. The radar albedo and circular polarization ratio are 0.4 and 0.8 at S-band and 0.3 and unity at X-band. The circular polarization ratios are larger than those of the majority of radar-observed asteroids and imply that 2004 DC has extreme decimeter-scale near-surface roughness.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroids pose a considerable threat to the safety of the Earth, where their impact would cause a huge disaster. For asteroid deflection, kinetic impact is an effective strategy. In this study, a smooth particle hydrodynamics approach is proposed to analyze the kinetic impact, considering the number, shape, size, and speed of the impactors. The simulation results demonstrate that the shape of the impactor will affect the deflection effect. The bullet-shaped impactor will result in larger velocity increment of the asteroid. Compared with a single impactor, multiple impactors with same total mass can deliver more momentum to the asteroid. Moreover, the velocity increment caused by multi-kinetic impactors are much larger. However, the number of multiple impactors have no significant influence on the momentum enhancement factor, which describes the efficiency of momentum transfer. When the total mass of impactors is the same, the momentum enhancement factor is mainly related to the impact speed and the ejecta from the impact. Therefore, the momentum enhancement factor is a composite indicator of both the destructiveness and deflection effects of an impact. For multiple kinetic impacts, the case with different shapes and different speeds gains a bigger momentum enhancement factor.", "title": ["Effectiveness analysis of multiple kinetic impacts of near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2022"}

{"abstract": "Asteroids (162173) Ryugu and (101955) Bennu observed by Hayabusa2 and Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) share many global properties, but high-spatial-resolution spectral observations by the telescopic Optical Navigation Camera (ONC-T) and MapCam detected subtle but significant differences (e.g., opposite space weathering trends), which may reflect differences in their origin and evolution. Comparing these differences on the same absolute scale is necessary for understanding their causes and obtaining implications for C-complex asteroids. However, ONC-T and MapCam have a large imager-to-imager systematic error of up to 15% caused by the difference in radiometric calibration targets. To resolve this problem, we cross calibrated albedo and color data between the two instruments using the Moon as the common calibration standard. The images of the Moon taken by ONC-T and MapCam were compared with those simulated using photometry models developed from lunar orbiter data. Our results show that the cross-calibrated reflectance of Ryugu and Bennu can be obtained by upscaling the pre-cross-calibrated reflectance of Bennu by 13.3 \u00b1 1.6% at b band, 13.2 \u00b1 1.5% at v band, 13.6 \u00b1 1.7% at w band, and 14.8 \u00b1 1.8% at x band, while those for Ryugu are kept the same. These factors compensate for the imager-to-imager bias caused by differences in targets used for radiometric calibration and solar irradiance models used for data reduction. Need for such large upscaling underscore the importance of using the cross-calibrated data for accurately comparing the Ryugu and Bennu data. The uncertainty in these factors show that the reflectance of Ryugu and Bennu can be compared with &lt;2% accuracy after applying our results. By applying our cross calibration, the geometric albedo of Bennu became consistent with those observed by ground-based telescopes and the OSIRIS-REx Visible and InfraRed Spectrometer (OVIRS).

The European Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM) is set to rendezvous with the asteroid system to fully characterize the smaller of the two binary components a few months prior to the impact by the US Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft. AIM is a unique mission as it will be the first time that a spacecraft will investigate the surface, subsurface, and internal properties of a small binary near-Earth asteroid. In addition it will perform various important technology demonstrations that can serve other space missions. <P />The knowledge obtained by this mission will have great implications for our understanding of the history of the Solar System. Having direct information on the surface and internal properties of small asteroids will allow us to understand how the various processes they undergo work and transform these small bodies as well as, for this particular case, how a binary system forms. Making these measurements from up close and comparing them with ground-based data from telescopes will also allow us to calibrate remote observations and improve our data interpretation of other systems. With DART, thanks to the characterization of the target by AIM, the mission will be the first fully documented impact experiment at asteroid scale, which will include the characterization of the target's properties and the outcome of the impact. AIDA will thus offer a great opportunity to test and refine our understanding and models at the actual scale of an asteroid, and to check whether the current extrapolations of material strength from laboratory-scale targets to the scale of AIDA's target are valid. Moreover, it will offer a first check of the validity of the kinetic impactor concept to deflect a small body and lead to improved efficiency for future kinetic impactor designs. <P />This paper focuses on the science return of AIM, the current knowledge of its target from ground-based observations, and the instrumentation planned to get the necessary data.", "title": ["Science case for the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM): A component of the Asteroid Impact &amp; Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission"], "year": "2016"}

A new deep learning pipeline using a convolutional neural network was developed for detecting faint, fast-moving near-Earth objects. It was trained with artificial streaks generated from simulations and was able to find these asteroid streaks with an accuracy of 98.7% and a false positive rate of 0.02% on simulated data. This program was used to search image data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in four nights from 2019 and identified six previously undiscovered asteroids besides confirming most previously discovered asteroids. The visual magnitudes of our detections range from ~19.0-20.3 and motion rates range from ~6.8-24 deg/day, which is very faint compared to other ZTF detections moving at similar motion rates. Our asteroids are also ~1-51 m diameter in size and ~5-60 lunar distances away at close approach, assuming their albedo values follow the albedo distribution function of known asteroids. The use of a purely simulated dataset to train our model enables the program to gain sensitivity in detecting faint and fast-moving objects, which tend to be missed by previously designed neural networks which used real detections to train neural networks.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a quantitative approach to specify potentially hazardous asteroids using clustering tools to group a set of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). The data pool adopted in the study contains a number of distinct indices characterizing \u223c25,000 NEAs. The hierarchical clustering (HC) and multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithmic techniques are adopted for generating two- and three-dimensional graphical representations reflecting the main features of the NEAs. These techniques provide useful computational visualization tools for extracting information embedded in data sets having multidimensional nature. The structure of the loci, given by the emerging clusters and patterns, leads to a deeper understanding of the problem. The HC and MDS rely on the selection of adequate metrics for comparing the objects in the data set. Therefore, a pool of prototype distances are tested and a number of numerical experiments reveal that the Clark distance characterizes more assertively the NEA data set. The overlapped clusters and the pattern of a curved polyhedron that emerge in the MDS charts reveal that some PHAs may be overlooked with standard classifications of NEAs based merely on some scalar index, such as the case of the perihelion distance \ud835\udc5e&lt;1.3 AU. Furthermore, it is observed that the MDS is superior in performance to the HC since it takes advantage of three-dimensional representations. In fact, three-dimensional plots require iterative operations of rotation, shifting and magnification for achieving an efficient visualization, but such procedures are straightforward with present day computational resources. This strategy allows the adoption of advanced scientific data processing and visualization techniques that lead to 'maps' close to our understanding of the NEA impact risk.", "title": ["Multidimensional Analysis of Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2022"}

{"abstract": "Most large (over a kilometre in diameter) near-Earth asteroids are now known, but recognition that airbursts (or fireballs resulting from nuclear-weapon-sized detonations of meteoroids in the atmosphere) have the potential to do greater damage than previously thought has shifted an increasing portion of the residual impact risk (the risk of impact from an unknown object) to smaller objects. Above the threshold size of impactor at which the atmosphere absorbs sufficient energy to prevent a ground impact, most of the damage is thought to be caused by the airburst shock wave, but owing to lack of observations this is uncertain. Here we report an analysis of the damage from the airburst of an asteroid about 19 metres (17 to 20 metres) in diameter southeast of Chelyabinsk, Russia, on 15 February 2013, estimated to have an energy equivalent of approximately 500 (+/-100) kilotons of trinitrotoluene (TNT, where 1 kiloton of TNT = 4.185\u00d710<SUP>12</SUP> joules). We show that a widely referenced technique of estimating airburst damage does not reproduce the observations, and that the mathematical relations based on the effects of nuclear weapons--almost always used with this technique--overestimate blast damage. This suggests that earlier damage estimates near the threshold impactor size are too high. We performed a global survey of airbursts of a kiloton or more (including Chelyabinsk), and find that the number of impactors with diameters of tens of metres may be an order of magnitude higher than estimates based on other techniques. This suggests a non-equilibrium (if the population were in a long-term collisional steady state the size-frequency distribution would either follow a single power law or there must be a size-dependent bias in other surveys) in the near-Earth asteroid population for objects 10 to 50 metres in diameter, and shifts more of the residual impact risk to these sizes.", "title": ["A 500-kiloton airburst over Chelyabinsk and an enhanced hazard from small impactors"], "year": "2013"}
{"abstract": "We observed near-Earth asteroid 2000 RS11 with the Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radars during a 0.035 au approach in March 2014, obtaining delay-Doppler images between March 13 and March 17. The finest-resolution images have range resolution of 7.5 m/pixel and show that RS11 is a contact binary with complex topography. We used the SHAPE software package (Magri et al., Icarus 186, 156-160 2007) to create a physical model of RS11 and its spin state from these delay-Doppler images.The rotation period of RS11 is well constrained from optical lightcurves, P = 4.444 \u00b1 0.001 h (Warner et al., Minor Planet Bulletin 41, 160; 2014 and Benishek, Minor Planet Bulletin 41, 257; 2014). We found two possible pole directions and corresponding shape models, mirror images of one another, which provide equally good fits to the radar data. RS11\u2019s pole direction is either (\u03bb , \u03b2) = (155\u00b0, 30\u00b0) \u00b1 10\u00b0 or (335\u00b0, -30\u00b0) \u00b1 10\u00b0 in J2000 ecliptic coordinates. The most likely pole directions of RS11 are not aligned with the heliocentric orbit normal and instead have an obliquity within 10\u00b0 of 56\u00b0 or 124\u00b0.Our best-fit shape models are 1400-vertex polyhedra comprising two lobes in contact. The lengths of RS11\u2019s principal axes are 698 \u00b1 71 m, 578 \u00b1 59 m, and 758 \u00b1 77 m. RS11 has a volume of 0.086 \u00b1 0.026 km^3. The long axis of RS11\u2019s larger lobe is 751 \u00b1 77 m and the long axis of the smaller lobe is 398 \u00b1 41 m; the volume ratio between these lobes is roughly 2.7 \u00b1 10%. Spectral data informs us that RS11 is an S-class object (Lazzarin et al., Icarus 169, 379; 2004).RS11's shape is unusual compared with those of other contact binary NEAs imaged by radar. Its larger lobe is flattened. Additionally, while the neck between the smaller and larger lobes of most contact binaries is located near the larger lobe's longest principal axis (such as in the cases of 25143 Itokawa and 4179 Toutatis), RS11's neck is near its larger lobe's shortest principal axis.

It was later reported to be a binary object based on lightcurve observations taken at the Ondrejov Observatory and radar observations obtained from the Arecibo telescope (IAUC 8336). Arecibo radar delay-Doppler images indicate that the diameters of the primary and secondary are approximately 1000 and 180 m respectively. In addition, the radar data demonstrate that the primary is irregular in shape, in contrast to other previously imaged binary asteroids, which have been noted to be almost spherical (e.g., 1998 ST27). <P />Near-infrared spectral data from 0.7 to 2.5 microns obtained of 2003 YT1 at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on May 9 and 10, 2004 UT shows well defined 1 and 2 micron features. Analyses of these features suggest that this near-Earth object has a surface assemblage dominated by orthopyroxene, perhaps with some accessory plagioclase. No detectable olivine is seen in the spectral data. The band positions of the absorption features suggest that the pyroxene chemistry is Wo8Fs32. Such pyroxene chemistry and the lack of any obvious olivine content suggest that this asteroid's parent body experienced significant heating with a large amount of eutectic melt production. <P />The inferred pyroxene mineralogy lies near that of the diogenite-eucrite boundary and suggests that 2003 YT1 may have a compositional affinity to these basaltic achondrite meteorites. As such this binary object could plausibly represent a portion of ejected material from the surface of asteroid 4 Vesta. The fact that the primary is an irregularly shaped object and the eccentric nature of the secondary's orbit, suggest that 2003 YT1 may be the result of fragments ejected from the surface of Vesta at low relative velocity. <P />This research is supported by NASA NEOO grant number NNG04GI17G.", "title": ["Compositional Results of Binary Near-Earth Asteroid 2003 YT1: A Basaltic Achondrite"], "year": "2004"}

We present an overview of general properties of the binary NEA population. Satellite sizes of all but one of the systems are in the range 0.2 to 0.5 primary's diameter, with the upper limit appearing significant. Primary diameters span most of the size range of rubble-pile near-Earth asteroids, i.e., from 0.2 km up to a few km. All but one system are asynchronous systems, with the primary rotating much faster than the mutual orbital period - most of the reliably estimated primary rotation periods are confined to the narrow range 2.2--2.8 h; the two outliers have primary periods of 3.594 h and 13.89 h. Orbital periods distribution shows a significant lower limit of \u223c 12 h while there is no obvious upper limit. Secondary rotations appear mostly (but not generally) synchronized with the mutual orbital motions. While primaries show lightcurves with low amplitudes indicating that they have roughly spheroidal shapes with low equatorial elongations, secondary lightcurves suggest that some of them have more elongated shapes.

{"abstract": "The Arecibo S-band radar system (2380 MHz, 12.6 cm) is an ideal method for studying the decimeter scale surface features of near-Earth asteroids. In all dual-polarization radar experiments, the echo from the asteroid is recorded in both the same circular (SC) and opposite circular (OC) sense as the transmitted wave. The ratio of these numbers, the circular polarization ratio (CPR), is an indicator of surface roughness on approximately wavelength scales. We present here preliminary results of a radar-image analysis regarding the surface feature characterization of 4 asteroids observed using the 305 meter Arecibo telescope during the past six years. Targets include the recently discovered equal mass binary system 2017 YE5, the Destiny<SUP>+</SUP> mission target 3200 Phaethon, the triple system 3122 Florence and 2005 GO<SUB>21</SUB>. Targets were selected based on their imaging resolution and number of observations (minimum two days). The backscattered power was then fit with a Bragg scattering model for both the SC and OC polarizations, which gives an indication of both the near-surface bulk density and surface roughness. To ensure enough data points for the fit, we added the additional criterion of at least 30 distinguishable pixels in both the vertical and horizontal axes (echo delay and Doppler shift, respectively), which gives sufficient coverage of incidence angles (the angle between the direction of propagation of the incident signal and the normal of the surface at the point of interest).

{"abstract": "We present results from a new grid-free 2D plasma simulation code applied to a small, unmagnetized body immersed in the streaming solar wind plasma. The body was purposely modeled as an irregular shape in order to examine photoemission and solar wind plasma flow in high detail on the dayside, nightside, terminator and surface-depressed \u2018pocket\u2019 regions. Our objective is to examine the overall morphology of the various plasma interaction regions that form around a small body like a small near-Earth asteroid (NEA). We find that the object obstructs the solar wind flow and creates a trailing wake region downstream, which involves the interplay between surface charging and ambipolar plasma expansion. Photoemission is modeled as a steady outflow of electrons from illuminated portions of the surface, and under direct illumination the surface forms a non-monotonic or \u201cdouble-sheath\u201d electric potential upstream of the body, which is important for understanding trajectories and equilibria of lofted dust grains in the presence of a complex asteroid geometry. The largest electric fields are found at the terminators, where ambipolar plasma expansion in the body-sized nightside wake merges seamlessly with the thin photoelectric sheath on the dayside. The pocket regions are found to be especially complex, with nearby sunlit regions of positive potential electrically connected to unlit negative potentials and forming adjacent natural electric dipoles. For objects near the surface, we find electrical dissipation times (through collection of local environmental solar wind currents) that vary over at least 5 orders of magnitude: from 39 \u03bcs inside the near-surface photoelectron cloud under direct sunlight to \u226b1 s inside the particle-depleted nightside wake and shadowed pocket regions.", "title": ["Grid-free 2D plasma simulations of the complex interaction between the solar wind and small, near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2014"}
{"abstract": "Binary near-Earth Asteroid (35107) 1991 VH approached Earth in August 2008 at a distance of 0.045 au. We used this opportunity to obtain an extensive set of radar observations between Jul. 29 and Aug.12 with Arecibo (2380 MHz, 13 cm) and Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm). The range-Doppler images have resolutions as fine as 15 m that spatially resolve both components in the system. Arecibo images show that the primary is roughly spheroidal with a visible range extent of 650 m. The images contain clear signatures of an equatorial ridge with longitudinal variations in its appearance. A concavity 100 meters in extent is present along the ridge. A radar-bright linear feature that casts a radar shadow down-range is visible in some of the images, and occurs at mid- to high-latitudes. A preliminary shape model fit to images of the primary reveals a top-shaped object with a volume equivalent diameter of roughly 1.2 km similar in shape to the (66391) 1999 KW4 primary (Ostro et al. 2006, Science 314, 1296).

{"abstract": "This work provides a statistical description of the near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in terms of number, orbital parameters, reflectance spectra, albedos, diameters, and terrestrial and lunar collision rates.

The NEA population is more highly inclined than previously estimated and the total number of NEAs with absolute magnitudes (H) brighter than 18 is 1227 (+170/-90). The absolute magnitude and orbital parameter distributions for the NEAs are combined with reflectance spectra and albedo measurements. I obtain a debiased estimate of the fraction of NEAs in each of 10 taxonomic complexes, and a debiased average albedo for each. The number of NEAs larger than 1 km is 1090\u00b1180. Next, I determine the impact frequency, collision velocity distribution and collision energy distribution for impacts of NEAs into the Earth and Moon. Globally destructive collisions (~10<SUP>21</SUP> J) of asteroids 1 km or larger strike the Earth once every 0.60\u00b10.1 Myr on average.

The International Scientific Optical Network (ISON) volunteer project commenced in 2004 intending to serve as an open repository of scientific data related to NES objects. At its zenith, the project collaborated with 33 observatories across 17 countries, operating 100 telescopes. Currently, ISON conducts its research using approximately 50 optical telescopes situated in 23 observatories across Europe, Asia, the Far East, Africa, and North &amp; South America. The network is coordinated in conjunction with the dedicated company Research and Development Institution ISON Orbital Dynamics (RD ISON-OD), which owns 32 telescopes, observation scheduling centers, and databases focusing on SD and asteroids.

The data collected by ISON on space debris contribute to validating space debris population models and conducting conjunction assessment analyses for satellites in high orbits. Additionally, ISON is developing technology for asteroid surveys using small telescopes, providing follow-up observations, and conducting regular photometry observations of near-Earth asteroids.

The radar data reveal echoes from two objects whose positions change with time and establish that 2018 EB is a binary system. The size of the primary is consistent with the diameter of 240 m estimated from NEOWISE data by J. Masiero (pers. comm.). The diameter of the moon is a few tens of meters in size and is among the smallest satellites discovered around any binary NEAs. The observations yielded delay-Doppler images achieving range resolutions as fine as 18.75 m/pixel that coarsely resolved the primary. The satellite is visible as a clump of bright pixels located several hundred meters up-range from the primary. The images do not span enough time to estimate the orbital period of the satellite. The lightcurves collected by one of us (B. D.

The NEA population, because of its proximity, allows us to explore asteroids at a size-range not possible among asteroids further away in the Main Belt. There are very few olivine-dominated asteroids, identified as spectroscopic A-types (Bus &amp; Binzel 2002, DeMeo et al. 2009), among the near-Earth population (Binzel et al. 2004). While a number of NEAs were labeled olivine-rich from visible wavelength data, near-infrared observations of these objects prove the olivine-rich population is exceedingly rare. We identify (1951) Lick, (5261) Eureka, and a new third A-type object, (5131) 1990 BG. Using a radiative transfer model (Shkuratov et al. 1999) and band parameter analysis we mineralogically characterize and compare these three olivine-rich A-type asteroids. Additionally, using the model from Bottke et al. 2002, we present main-belt source regions for these bodies.

{"abstract": "For purposes of defining a population vs. size, we define a Near-Earth asteroid as one with a perihelion less than 1.3 AU, and we measure size in terms of absolute magnitude H, rather than actual size. Earlier estimates of the population with H &lt; 18.0 (generally considered to correspond to diameter &gt; 1 km) range from as many as 2000 to as few as 750. I have estimated the population in two ways: (1) by extrapolating a model fit over the range where surveys are complete already (H &lt; 14.5) down to H = 18.0; and (2) by dividing the numbers of already discovered asteroids by the ratio of the number of new discoveries to total detections (new plus re-detections) in the last year. Method (1) yields a population estimate of about 1500 brighter (larger) than H = 18.0, and method (2) yields about 1000. The uncertainty in either method is about equal to the separation between the values.

{"abstract": "Past activity from Near Earth Asteroids is recorded in the meteoroid streams that cause our meteor showers. Automated meteoroid orbit surveys by photographic, low-light video, specular radar, and head-echo radar reflections are providing the first maps of meteor shower activity at different particle sizes. There are distinct differences in particle size distributions among streams. The underlaying mechanisms that created these streams are illuminated: fragmentation from spin-up or thermal stresses, meteoroid ejection by water vapor drag, and ejection of icy particles by CO and CO2 sublimation. The distribution of the meteoroid orbital elements probe the subsequent evolution by planetary perturbations and sample the range of dynamical processes to which Near Earth Asteroids are exposed. The non-stream \"sporadic\" meteors probe early stages in the evolution from meteoroid streams into the zodiacal dust cloud. We see that the lifetime of large meteoroids is generally not limited by collisions. Results obtained by the CAMS video survey of meteoroid orbits are compared to those from other orbit surveys. Since October 2010, over 200,000 meteoroid orbits have been measured. First results from an expansion into the southern hemisphere are also presented, as are first results from the measurement of main element compositions. Among the many streams detected so far, the Geminid and Sextantid showers stand out by having a relatively high particle density and derive from parent bodies that appear to have originated in the main belt.", "title": ["Active Near Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2015"}
{"abstract": "The near-Earth object (NEO) population is composed of asteroids and comets that have orbits close to the Earth. This vicinity to the Earth gives us some advantages, because this population is the most accessible vestige from the building blocks that formed the Solar System, for spacecrafts, and for detailed observations from ground-based facilities. The NEO Rapid Observation, Characterization and Key Simulations (NEOROCKS) project has been recently funded (2020-2022) through the H2020 European Commission program to improve the knowledge on near-Earth Objects (NEOs) by connecting expertise in performing small body astronomical observations and the related modelling needed to derive their dynamical and physical properties. The members of Solar System Group of the Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias (IAC) lead a task on the NEOROCKS project to do observations of NEOs in support of the Arecibo Planetary Radar Program, using the facilities located at the Observatorios de Canarias (OOCC) and managed by IAC. These observations include times-series photometry (light-curves), visible to near-infrared spectroscopy, and color photometry. We are focusing in those targets observed by the Arecibo telescope and which have high signal-to-noise radar data. Our observations included the NEAs, (351545) 2005 TE15, (438908) 2009 XO, (501647) 2014 SD224, 2015 FC35, and 2016 CO247. We selected these targets because none of them has photometric parameters determined on any photometric public's database. We obtained time-series photometry for all of them. We obtained the light-curves using the TAR2 at TAR (Remote Open Telescope, Telescopio Abierto Remoto) installation. This telescope is a robotic observatory with two 42cm diameter Centurion telescopes (TAR1 and TAR2), equipped with high-sensitivity FLI-Kepler sCMOS cameras and located at Teide Observatory (Tenerife). In the case of spectro-photometric data, we used the MuSCAT-2 instrument, mounted on the 1.52-m Carlos Sanchez Telescope, located also at Teide Observatory. For NEAs 438908 and 501647 we obtained the color from the Sloan Sky Digital Survey. To process the images and to obtain the magnitudes we used the Photometry Pipeline (PP). We are using the software MPO Canopus to obtain the rotational period. We present the results from this analysis and the physical properties of our targets as part of NEOROCKS. The variability of the physical properties of NEAs makes it impossible to predict what values we will find, but each set of data give to us an understanding of the properties of each subgroup of the NEOs population.", "title": ["Physical properties of 5 near-Earth asteroids observed with the Arecibo Planetary Radar within NEOROCKS project."], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "A small number of anomalously bright boulders on the near-Earth rubble-pile asteroid (101955) Bennu were recently identified as eucritic material originating from asteroid (4) Vesta. Building on this discovery, we explored the global presence of exogenic boulders on Bennu. Our analysis focused on boulders larger than 1 m that show the characteristic 1 \u03bcm pyroxene absorption band in the four-color MapCam data from the OSIRIS-REx mission. We confirm the presence of exogenic boulders similar to eucrites and find that a mixture of eucrite with carbonaceous material is also a possible composition for some boulders. Some of the exogenic boulders have spectral properties similar to those of ordinary chondrite (OC) meteorites, although the laboratory spectra of these meteorites have a higher albedo than those measured on Bennu, which could be explained by either a grain size effect, the presence of impact melt, or optical mixing with carbonaceous material owing to dust coating. Our Monte Carlo simulations predict that the median amount of OC mass added to the parent body of Bennu is 0.055% and 0.037% of the volume of a 100 and 200 km diameter parent body, respectively. If Bennu was a uniformly mixed by-product of parent body and S-type projectiles, the equivalent mass of OC material would be a sphere with a diameter of 36-40 m (or a volume of 24,200-33,600 m<SUP>3</SUP>).

The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico is a key facility for post-discovery characterization of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and for studies of celestial bodies from Mercury out to the icy moons of Saturn. The 2.38-GHz planetary radar system actively contributes to the investigation of physical and dynamical properties of NEAs by high-precision characterization of up to 120 NEAs annually. Planetary radar observations offer unparalleled imaging capabilities of NEAs that can directly reveal their shape, surface morphology, spin, and binarity. Furthermore, radar data can provide clues to the NEAs' geology and near-surface physical properties at centimeter-to-decimeter size scales. These characteristics are invaluable information for understanding the formation and evolution of NEAs, the building blocks of our Solar System, for evaluating impact risk and developing impact mitigation technologies, and for ensuring safe spacecraft encounters. <P />Some of the recent science highlights include discovery of the binary natures of 2020 BX12 observed in January 2020 and 2016 AZ8 observed in January 2019, craters and hills on the surfaces of (52768) 1998 OR2 observed in April 2020 and (68950) 2002 QF15 observed in June-May 2019, and the removal of the 1-km sized asteroid 2020 NK1 from the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies Sentry list (and other virtual impactor lists) as a direct result of the radar observations on July 31.

Phaethon is regularly exposed to temperatures up to 1000 Kelvin when passing through its perihelion, and these extreme perihelion heat pulses offer the mechanism to explain the thermal metamorphism of CM meteorites.

The aim of this paper is to provide an approach to selecting a target and evaluating accessibility for rendezvous with a Near-Earth Asteroid mission, taking into account scientific value and engineering feasibility. Firstly, according to the orbital characteristics and physical properties of Near-Earth asteroids, we make a summary of some of the most frequent factors influencing the target selection of scientific significance. When selecting the target for a space mission, these factors can be regarded as the scientific motivations. Then in order to avoid the possibility that some high priority targets for science would be discarded due to requiring too high an energy budget by using a classical direct transfer strategy, we calculate the transfer trajectory for rendezvous with candidates by using the planetary swingby technique and the global optimal two-impulse method.

{"abstract": "We observed the near-Earth binary system 2000 CO101 in 2009 September using the Goldstone and Arecibo radar systems and inverted these images to create shape models of the primary. Asteroid 2000 CO101 was discovered to be a binary system from Arecibo images taken on 2009 September 26 (Taylor et al. 2009). Analyzing the images, we were able to determine approximate values for the radius of the primary (310 m) and the radius of the secondary (22 m). The maximum observed range separation was approximately 610 m. The images show it to appear spherical. Shape modeling of the primary of this system will constrain the asteroid's size, spin rate, and pole orientation. Because other NEA binary systems have exhibited shapes similar to that of 1999 KW4 (Ostro et al. 2006, Scheeres et al. 2006), we initially adopted this shape for 2000 CO101 and have allowed only the linear scales along the three principal axes to adjust to the radar data. This enables us to constrain the volume. With some constraints on the orbit of the satellite we will place limits on the density of the primary. <P />The near-infrared spectrum of 2000 CO101 was measured on 2009 September 21 and 2010 March 13.

{"abstract": "We report radar imaging of near-Earth asteroid 2004 BL86 obtained at Goldstone, Arecibo, Green Bank, and elements of the Very Long Baseline Array between 2015 January 26-31. 2004 BL86 approached within 0.0080 au on January 26, the closest known approach by any object with an absolute magnitude brighter than ~19 until 2027. Prior to the encounter, virtually nothing was known about its physical properties other than its absolute magnitude of 19, which suggested a diameter within a factor of two of 500 m. 2004 BL86 was a very strong radar target that provided an outstanding opportunity for radar imaging and physical characterization. Delay-Doppler images with range resolutions as fine as 3.75 m placed thousands of pixels on the object and confirmed photometric results reported by Pravec et al. (2015, CBET 4063) that 2004 BL86 is a binary system. During the observations, the asteroid moved more than 90 deg and provided a range of viewing geometries. The bandwidth was relatively narrow on Jan. 26, reached a maximum on Jan. 27, and then narrowed on Jan. 28, a progression indicating that the subradar latitude moved across the equator during those days. The images reveal a rounded primary with an equatorial diameter of ~350 m, evidence for ridges, possible boulders, and a pronounced angular feature ~100 m in diameter near one of the poles. Images from Jan. 26 show arcs of radar-bright pixels on the approaching and receding limbs that extend well behind the trailing edge in the middle of the echo. This is the delay-Doppler signature of an oblate shape seen at least a few tens of degrees off the equator. A rough estimate for the diameter of the secondary is ~70 m and its narrow bandwidth is consistent with the 14-h orbital period reported by Pravec et al. (2015). The images are suitable for 3D shape, pole, orbit, and mass estimation. The observations utilized new data taking equipment at Green Bank to receive X-band (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) transmissions from the 70 m DSS-14 facility, and, for the first time, transmissions using a new C-band (7190 MHz, 4.2 cm) radar at the 34 m DSS-13 antenna at the Goldstone complex.", "title": ["Radar imaging of binary near-Earth asteroid (357439) 2004 BL86"], "year": "2015"}

The process of identification of a NEA family is difficult due to the chaotic dynamics of the whole NEA region which is responsible for the rapid diffusion of members of the family into the background and short dynamical lifetime of all objects present. Using 1000 realistic NEAmodels we determined the statistical significance of the candidate NEA families detected in the real NEA sample from the actual Minor Planet Center asteroid orbital database mpcorb.dat. The identification of an NEA family will provide constraints on the NEA population's collisional processes and their dynamical evolution and internal structure.

The software package PRISM was used to calibrate the CCD fields and measure the positions of 99942 Apophis and 2013 TV135, and our own software was used for 367943 Duende.

{"abstract": "Near Earth Asteroids represent a real danger for the Earth. An impact of a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid could have catastrophic consequences. The knowledge of the actual dynamic of Potential Hazardous Asteroids is essential for the purpose of an international program of planetary defense. In this respect, accurate astrometric measurements acquired over a large time span are crucial to provide reliable orbits and impact predictions and to detect small accelerations such as Yarkovsky effect. This in particular includes precovery observations. The NAROO digitization centre 1, 2 is dedicated to the digitization and the analysis of old astronomical observations on astrophotographic plates. Digitizations are made with a high precision digitizer composed of high-resolution camera and a plate holder mounted on an air cushion table moving on granite based out of vibrations. Glass plates up to 35 cm wide can be digitized. The resulting digitization has an accuracy better than 65 nm for the measurements. Astrophotographic plates constitute a source of old observations of solar system objects including Potential Hazardous Asteroids. Some of these old observations are precovery observations of these objects. The existing databases gather all the metadata of the past observations such as date, hour, right ascension, declination and exposure which are essential to retrieve all the objects present in the observation. New orbit solutions of a selection of Potential Hazardous Asteroids were done from their positions on astrophotographic plates, thanks to the identification of their old and/or precovery observations among databases and to their new reduction with Gaia catalog. It shows an improvement of the accuracy of their new ephemeris 2 to 10 times better depending on the asteroid hence the interest of using these old observations. Next step will be not only to detect and to quantify small perturbations affecting asteroids such as Yarkovsky effect but also to refine accurate impact predictions thanks to these new orbital solutions. <P />1 The NAROO digitization centre, V.

{"abstract": "Technology has advanced to the point that it is possible to image the entire sky every night and process the data in real time. The sky is hardly static: many interesting phenomena occur, including variable stationary objects such as stars or QSOs, transient stationary objects such as supernovae or M dwarf flares, and moving objects such as asteroids and the stars themselves. Funded by NASA, we have designed and built a sky survey system for the purpose of finding dangerous near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). This system, the \u201cAsteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\u201d (ATLAS), has been optimized to produce the best survey capability per unit cost, and therefore is an efficient and competitive system for finding potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) but also for tracking variables and finding transients. While carrying out its NASA mission, ATLAS now discovers more bright (m &lt; 19) supernovae candidates than any ground based survey, frequently detecting very young explosions due to its 2 day cadence. ATLAS discovered the afterglow of a gamma-ray burst independent of the high energy trigger and has released a variable star catalog of 5 \u00d7 10<SUP>6</SUP> sources.

{"abstract": "Navigation of the orbit phase of the Near Earth steroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission will re,quire determination of certain physical parameters describing the size, shape, gravity field, attitude and inertial properties of Eros. Prior to launch, little was known about Eros except for its orbit which could be determined with high precision from ground based telescope observations. Radar bounce and light curve data provided a rough estimate of Eros shape and a fairly good estimate of the pole, prime meridian and spin rate. However, the determination of the NEAR spacecraft orbit requires a high precision model of Eros's physical parameters and the ground based data provides only marginal a priori information. Eros is the principal source of perturbations of the spacecraft's trajectory and the principal source of data for determining the orbit. The initial orbit determination strategy is therefore concerned with developing a precise model of Eros. The original plan for Eros orbital operations was to execute a series of rendezvous burns beginning on December 20,1998 and insert into a close Eros orbit in January 1999. As a result of an unplanned termination of the rendezvous burn on December 20, 1998, the NEAR spacecraft continued on its high velocity approach trajectory and passed within 3900 km of Eros on December 23, 1998. The planned rendezvous burn was delayed until January 3, 1999 which resulted in the spacecraft being placed on a trajectory that slowly returns to Eros with a subsequent delay of close Eros orbital operations until February 2001. The flyby of Eros provided a brief glimpse and allowed for a crude estimate of the pole, prime meridian and mass of Eros. More importantly for navigation, orbit determination software was executed in the landmark tracking mode to determine the spacecraft orbit and a preliminary shape and landmark data base has been obtained. The flyby also provided an opportunity to test orbit determination operational procedures that will be used in February of 2001. The initial attitude and spin rate of Eros, as well as estimates of reference landmark locations, are obtained from images of the asteroid. These initial estimates are used as a priori values for a more precise refinement of these parameters by the orbit determination software which combines optical measurements with Doppler tracking data to obtain solutions for the required parameters. As the spacecraft is maneuvered; closer to the asteroid, estimates of spacecraft state, asteroid attitude, solar pressure, landmark locations and Eros physical parameters including mass, moments of inertia and gravity harmonics are determined with increasing precision. The determination of the elements of the inertia tensor of the asteroid is critical to spacecraft orbit determination and prediction of the asteroid attitude. The moments of inertia about the principal axes are also of scientific interest since they provide some insight into the internal mass distribution. Determination of the principal axes moments of inertia will depend on observing free precession in the asteroid's attitude dynamics. Gravity harmonics are in themselves of interest to science. When compared with the asteroid shape, some insight may be obtained into Eros' internal structure. The location of the center of mass derived from the first degree harmonic coefficients give a direct indication of overall mass distribution. The second degree harmonic coefficients relate to the radial distribution of mass. Higher degree harmonics may be compared with surface features to gain additional insight into mass distribution. In this paper, estimates of Eros physical parameters obtained from the December 23,1998 flyby will be presented. This new knowledge will be applied to simplification of Eros orbital operations in February of 2001. The resulting revision to the orbit determination strategy will also be discussed.", "title": ["Determination of Eros Physical Parameters for Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous Orbit Phase Navigation"], "year": "1995"}
{"abstract": "We analyze a sample of 58 Jupiter family comets (JFCs) in near-Earth orbits, defined as those whose perihelion distances at the time of discovery were q<SUB>disc</SUB> &lt; 1.3 au. In our definition JFCs have Tisserand parameters 2 &lt; T &lt; 3 and orbital periods P &lt; 20 yr. We integrated the orbits of these objects, plus 50 clones for each one of them, for 10<SUP>4</SUP> yr in the past and in the future. We find that most of them move on highly unstable orbits, having fallen in their current near-Earth orbits in the recent past, going from less than one hundred years to a few thousands years. They experience frequent close encounters with Jupiter down to distances \u2272 0.1 au. This is the expected behavior for comets whose limited physical lifetimes in the near-Earth region make them unlikely to survive there for more than about a few hundred revolutions. In this sense the orbits of most JFCs are typically \"cometary\", and they should be regarded as newcomers in the near-Earth region. Yet, a minor fraction of JFCs (less than about one third) are found to move on stable orbits for the past \u223c 10<SUP>4</SUP> yr, and in some cases are found to continue to be stable at 5 \u00d7 10<SUP>4</SUP> yr in the past. They also avoid very close encounters with Jupiter. Their orbital behavior is very similar to that of NEAs in cometary orbits. While \"typical\" JFCs in unstable orbits probably come from the trans-Neptunian region, the minor group of JFCs in asteroidal orbits may come from the main asteroid belt, like the NEAs. The asteroidal JFCs may have a more consolidated structure and a higher mineral content than that of comets coming from the trans-Neptunian belt or the Oort cloud, which could explain their much longer physical lifetimes in the near-Earth region. In particular, we mention comets 66P/du Toit, 162P/Siding Spring, 169P/NEAT, 182P/LONEOS, 189P/NEAT, 249P/LINEAR, 300P/Catalina, and P/2003 T12 (SOHO) as the most likely candidates to have an origin in the main asteroid belt.

{"abstract": "Using numerical modeling of the rotational dynamics of asteroid (99942) Apophis, the disturbances that occur in the rotational motion of asteroids during their close approaches to the Earth were studied. Such events can lead to significant changes in the speed of the asteroid's own rotation and the orientation of its rotation axis in space. Assuming that the figure of Apophis is approximated by a triaxial ellipsoid, the dependences of changes in the rotation period of an asteroid on the parameters of the orbit and its rotational state before approaching the Earth were studied. It has been established that the rotation period of Apophis, which is currently about 30 h, may change due to the next approach to Earth in 2029 very significantly\u2014to 10-15 h; in numerical experiments, both acceleration and deceleration of the asteroid's rotation were observed. Perturbations in the rotational motion of the asteroid noticeably affect its further orbital dynamics as a result of changes in the magnitude of the Yarkovsky effect. It was concluded that as a result of close approach, the average rate of change of the semimajor axis of Apophis's orbit caused by the Yarkovsky effect, which is currently about 200 m/year, may decrease to 160 m/year or increase to 300 m/year.", "title": ["Disturbances in the Rotational Dynamics of Asteroid (99942) Apophis at its Approach to the Earth in 2029"], "year": "2024"}
{"abstract": "The nu<SUB>6</SUB> secular resonance provides an effective inner and high-inclination boundary to the main asteroid belt in the proper element space, as objects inserted into it can undergo drastic secular changes of eccentricity and become Mars-and Earth-crossers. We have used Morbidelli's (1993) theory for the secular evolution of the orbits lying inside the resonance and Farinella's et al. (1993a) model for the isotropic ejection of fragments following collisions against existing main-belt asteroids, to study the efficiency of 20 asteroids close to the nu<SUB>6</SUB> resonance as potential deliverers of planet-crossing fragments. We have found that several of these asteroids do inject into the resonance a significant fraction of their fragments, which then have their orbital eccentricities increased up to Mars-and even Earth-crossing values. Therefore some of these bodies-in particular the largest ones, like 6 Hebe, 304 Olga, 739 Mandeville and 759 Vinifera-are probably efficient deliverers of meteorites. The time required for these fragments to be transported into Earth-crossing orbits is typically of the order of 10<SUP>6</SUP> yr when the eccentricity is directly pumped up by the resonance to approximately = 0.6, longer when Mars encounters are needed as an intermediate process. Other asteroids inject a substantial fraction of their fragments into the 3/1 (623 Chimaera, 1892 Lucienne) and 5/2 (631 Philippina, 907 Rhoda, 1222 Tina) Kirkwood gaps.

{"abstract": "It is generally recognized that main-belt asteroids (MBAs) and nuclei of extinct comets are two main sources for the near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) replenishment. Theoretical studies of NEA dynamics and numerical modelling of their orbital motions showed that so-called resonance mechanism for supplying NEAs is quite sufficient to sustain this population. The physical properties of NEAs and MBAs (and partly of comet nuclei) were compared to understand what the physical properties of NEAs can tell us about sources of their origin. The results of the comparison are given in this paper. The principal results of such a comparative analysis can be reduced to the following. All the NEAs have the small sizes, almost the same variety of their taxonomic classes and mineralogy, predominance of differentiated assemblages among them, approximately similar shape and rotation, optical properties and surface structure as compared to those of MBAs. All these conclusions clearly indicate that the main asteroid belt is the principal source of NEA, and comet nuclei contribution to the total NEA population does not exceed 10%.

{"abstract": "Asteroid 2008 EV5 is currently one of the possible targets of NASA Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM). The objective of this mission is to recover a boulder from the surface of an asteroid. The selection of the final target requires understanding the physical characteristics of the asteroid such as the size-frequency distribution of boulders on the asteroid's surface, the presence of volatiles on the surface and below, the strength of the surface materials and the degree of their alteration. In our work, we focus on the second criterion, the possibility of volatiles presence on 2008 EV5. These can be expected to survive embedded within the crystal lattice of various phyllosilicates. The positive presence of volatiles on the surface of and inside the asteroid is important especially for ISRU hardware demonstrations. Spectral data suggest that 2008 EV5 is a member of CI chondrite group which is characterized by high phyllosilicate content (~70%) but there is also the possibility of it being a CR chondrite where the phyllosilicate content ranges significantly, from samples with negligible phyllosilicate content to samples with almost 70% phyllosilicate content. If the dynamical history of the asteroid brought it close enough to the Sun, the lattice of phyllosilicates could have disintegrated and released the volatiles (water) and the material could have dehydrated. The depth at which the dehydration might have taken place depends on the characteristic depth of heat wave penetration which in turn depends on material characteristics such as density, heat capacity and heat conductivity. These are in turn are closely linked to the porosity. The characteristic heat penetration depth also depends on orbital geometry and rotational and orbital periods. Besides the temperature itself, the dehydration is also affected by the duration of the crystal lattice breakup temperatures. We use thermal model in conjunction with available experimental data on the dehydration of clays and with the model of near Earth asteroids to determine the possible scenarios of dehydration of 2008 EV5.", "title": ["Volatile Survival on Near-Earth Asteroid 2008 EV5"], "year": "2016"}

{"abstract": "Top Shaped Asteroids (TSAs) have proven to be common amongst the near-Earth rubble pile population, with multiple examples confirmed via groundbased radar and spaceborne optical sensors through the past 20 years. A substantial body of literature has developed, exploring the formation of these unique shapes either through rotation-induced landslides and creep, or collisional reaccumulation. Models of such mass movements can provide good explanations for mid and low latitude material redistribution, but Bennu also shows a significant increase in radius in the high polar regions, which is harder to explain with these processes. The discovery of repeated and probably ongoing particle ejections around the 500 m diameter asteroid Bennu by the OSIRIS-REx mission suggests that we need to consider an alternate or additional mechanism which, we show, can anticipate the detailed variety of TSA shapes. This paper explores asteroid shape evolution as the result of particle ejections, modeled as being simply correlated with latitude via diurnal heating (or meteorite impacts), and re-accumulation using simulations including gravity and solar radiation pressure. Asteroid outlines are evolved with time as a function of particle ejection velocities and asteroid rotation rates. Bennu's shape can be anticipated by our model with RMS surface errors of less than 1.1% (2.7 m) although some southern latitudes have errors up to 10 m. Straightforward variation in conditions can produce shapes matching other TSAs. However, the observed particle fluxes on Bennu are approximately 3 orders of magnitude too low for this to be the only shaping mechanism on Bennu. The time necessary to form these shapes by our mechanism alone is far longer than the lifetimes of near-Earth asteroids, unless fluxes were once much greater, or there was an underlying oblate shape.", "title": ["Possible particle ejection contributions to the shape and spin stability of small near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2022"}
{"abstract": "Radar observations are a powerful technique to study near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). The Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radars can provide delay-Doppler images that can directly resolve surface features such as concavities, hills, ridges, and boulders. Goldstone's 3.75-m resolution capability is invaluable when attempting to image NEAs with diameters smaller than 50 m. To date, over 430 near-Earth asteroids and 136 main-belt asteroids have been observed with radar. 80 % of the radar-detected NEAs have been observed within the last 10 years. The radar detection rate in the last three years has tripled relative to the average in the previous decade due to an increase in funding and greater scheduling flexibility. <P />Currently, \u223c400 observing hours per year at Goldstone and \u223c600 observing hours per year at Arecibo are devoted to observing asteroids. We strive to observe all strong and moderately strong imaging targets, Yarkovsky drift candidates, NEOWISE targets, asteroids with very low perihelia that can be used to measure solar oblateness, and as many other detectable asteroids as resources allow. We also regularly attempt to observe any asteroid that is flagged by the Near-Earth Object Human Spaceflight Accessible Targets Study (NHATS) list (http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/nhats/). To date, we have observed more than 60 NHATS objects at Arecibo and Goldstone. <P />In the past three years, \u223c1/3 of the detected asteroids were targets of opportunity (TOOs), some of which we observed within 24 h from when the discoveries were announced. Many TOOs are small, rapidly moving objects that are detectable by radar only within few lunar distances. Radar astrometry is particularly important for these asteroids because they are too faint to be followed for long with optical telescopes. A radar-range measurement often secures their orbit for decades or centuries, where otherwise the object would be lost and require rediscovery. In one of the extreme cases, two delay and two Doppler measurements from Goldstone prevented a newly discovered potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) 2014 CU_{13} from being lost. The measurements also extended its Earth-encounter predictability by 1000 years. Radar observations of objects that are closer than \u223c4 lunar distances (\u223c10.3 seconds RTT, round-trip-time for signal) previously required coordination between two stations (one for transmit and one for receive) due to the short RTT and need to physically switch between transmit and receive configurations. However, the switching process has been accelerated and recent observations of 2013 XY_8 have shown that Goldstone can now conduct monostatic observations with RTTs of \u223c5 seconds. This provides much stronger signal-to-noise ratios for very close targets. <P />With the rapidly growing number of radar detections, some population trends are emerging. The latest statistics show that the fraction of contact binaries has grown to \u223c14 % and is now comparable to that of true binaries in the NEA population with diameters larger than 200 m. We are also starting to capture what may be the tail ends of certain sub-populations. For example, we have found two very small binary systems, 2003 SS_{84} and 2004 FG_{11}, that have primaries &lt; 200 m in diameter; we have also found that 2005 AY_{28} and 2013 JR_{28} are contact binaries in the same size range.

{"abstract": "Thermal inertia and bulk density are two important properties that describe the surface morphology and internal structure of asteroids. Since thermal inertia depends predominantly on regolith particle size and depth, degree of compaction, and exposure of solid rocks and boulders within the top few centimeters of the sub-surface, it can be used to infer the presence or absence of loose material on the asteroid surface [1,2]. When the asteroid bulk density is compared with that of meteorites associated with the asteroid spectral type, then it allows the macro-porosity of the asteroid to be determined. The macro-porosity can then be used to infer whether the asteroid is predominantly a solid body throughout, a fractured body, or a rubble-pile [3]. Each structural classification gives different insights into how the asteroid formed and evolved. <P />The thermal inertia and bulk density can be determined by simultaneous thermophysical modeling of thermal-infrared and Yarkovsky orbital drift observations. Thermal inertia is a measure of a material's resistance to temperature change and dictates the asteroid surface temperature distribution. Different thermal inertia values can be detected in thermal-infrared observations, and can be inferred by using a suitable thermophysical model that takes into account the asteroid's shape, rotation state, surface roughness, and observing geometry. The surface temperature distribution influenced by thermal inertia causes a morning-afternoon temperature asymmetry, which leads to an excess of thermally emitted photons on the afternoon side. This excess of photons applies a very small force to the afternoon side of the asteroid, which causes the orbital semimajor axis to increase or decrease slowly over time, depending on whether the asteroid is a prograde or retrograde rotator (i.e., the Yarkovsky effect [4]). The rate of Yarkovsky semimajor axis drift is dictated by the asteroid thermal inertia and bulk density, amongst other important properties, and can be modeled by using a similar thermophysical model to that which is used to interpret thermal-infrared observations. Model-to-measurement comparisons of the Yarkovsky semimajor axis drift can then allow the asteroid bulk density to be determined. <P />The Advanced Thermophysical Model (or ATPM) is the only thermophysical model currently available that can simultaneously interpret thermal-infrared observations and make Yarkovsky effect predictions [2][5][6]. It has already been used to determine the thermal inertia and bulk density of near-Earth asteroids (1620) Geographos [7], (1862) Apollo [8], and (101955) Bennu [9], and has also been used to investigate the asteroid YORP effect (i.e., asteroid spin-state changes caused by the asymmetric reflection and re-radiation of sunlight from an irregular shape [4]). In the current work presented here, the ATPM has been applied to near-Earth asteroids that have suitable thermal-infrared, shape model, and Yarkovsky effect datasets in the available literature in order to significantly increase the number of characterized near-Earth asteroids. This involves exploiting the DAMIT [10] and radar [11] shape model databases, the lists of current Yarkovsky detections [12][13], and the NEOWISE catalogue of observed near-Earth asteroids [14] as well as other available sources. By combining our investigation with previously published studies of individual near-Earth asteroids, we aim to more deeply investigate the apparent trend of increasing thermal inertia with decreasing diameter [1], and seek any relationships that exist between thermal inertia, bulk density, and other asteroid properties. The latest results will be presented and discussed.", "title": ["Thermal inertia and bulk density of near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2014"}
{"abstract": "Radar delay-Doppler observations provide images of celestial objects with a resolution as fine as less than 10 meters per pixel. The dual-polarimetric observations can be used for characterizing the near-surfaces of asteroids, planets, and the Moon in terms of structural composition in centimeter-to-meter scale. The radar signal is typically transmitted fully circularly polarized, and the echo power in the opposite-circular (OC) and the same-circular (SC) polarization can be analyzed to evaluate the near-surface composition and surface roughness. Limited analysis can be done based on single values such as the radar albedo or circular polarization ratio (the ratio of echo power in the SC polarization divided by that in the OC polarization) or further analysis based on the disk function, i.e., the backscatter coefficient as a function of the incidence angle (\u03b8<SUB>i</SUB>), typically modeled using a cosine law: \u03c3<SUB>0</SUB> = R(C+1) cos<SUP>2C</SUP>\u03b8<SUB>i</SUB>, where R and C are the fitting parameters for the reflectivity and the surface roughness, respectively. <P />We conducted numerical simulations of radar scattering to characterize near-surfaces of asteroids using the disk function analysis. We modeled the disk functions by integrating the radar reflectivity of the asteroid in a delay-Doppler image over the frequency space, by converting the range into an incidence angle estimate based on an assumption of a spherical object, and by normalizing the function using the radar cross sections. Figure 1 shows an example of a disk function for (371660) 2007 CN26 with a fitted cosine-law model (R=0.08 and C=0.61 for the OC polarization). Only near-Earth asteroids that appear spheroidal in the delay-Doppler images, are greater than 140 meters, and were observed using the Arecibo S-band (2380 MHz, 12.6 cm) radar system were included in this quantitative analysis to constrain the parameter space. We used publicly available software: PyRISM to model the disk functions in the OC polarization and discrete-dipole approximation code ADDA for the SC polarization chosen based on the discovered strengths and weaknesses of each code. We present how well each software could model the disk functions, the general statistics for the fitted R and C values, and what role the asteroid taxonomy plays in the reflectivity and surface roughness based on those statistics. <P />Cross-listed as presentation #207.02.", "title": ["Characterizing surfaces of near-Earth asteroids using radar scattering"], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "The Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) spacecraft has been conducting a survey of the sky in two thermal infrared wavelengths since its reactivation in December of 2013. NEOWISE orbits the Earth in a sun-synchronous polar orbit, surveying a ring a sky near quadrature. Due to NEOWISE's scan pattern, it obtains repeated images of the same area of the sky, with most asteroids receiving 8-10 observations over the course of approximately 1 day. The WISE Moving Object Processing System (WMOPS) searches this data stream for moving objects, reporting new and known objects that meet our search criteria to the Minor Planet Center. Periodically, manual searches are used to recover near-Earth objects outside of the WMOPS detection thresholds. <P />NEOWISE captures images simultaneously at 3.4 microns and 4.6 microns. For objects near the orbit of Earth, the 4.6 micron bandpass is dominated by thermal emission, which allows for thermal modeling to provide a constraint on the size of the object. When ground-based visible light measurements are also available, an albedo can be computed based on the thermal-infrared diameter. Since the beginning of reactivation, NEOWISE has obtained diameter and albedo characterization data for over 1200 near-Earth objects.

{"abstract": "The Flora family dominates the innermost region of the main asteroid belt. It was formed from the catastrophic disruption of an S-type parent body larger than 150 km in diameter in a region adjacent to the nu6 secular resonance. Family members, when pushed onto planet-crossing orbits, tend to have relatively high probabilities of striking the Earth. These factors suggest that the Flora family may be a primary source of present-day LL chondrite-like NEOs as well as Earth/Moon impactors. To investigate this possibility, we used collisional and dynamical models to track the evolution of Flora family members immediate after the family-forming event. We created an initial Flora family and followed test asteroids 1 and 3 km in diameter using a numerical code that accounted for both planetary perturbations and non-gravitational effects (e.g., Yarkovsky and YORP thermal forces). We find that our test Flora family members can reproduce the observed semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination distributions of the real family after 1 to 1.5 Gyr of evolution. We favor the latter age, since it allow us to reproduce the surface age inferred from crater spatial densities found on Flora-family member (951) Gaspra. To get this age, most family members had to have bulk densities near 2.7 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Our combined collisional and dynamical runs indicate that the family has lost nearly 90% of its initial kilometer-sized members. At its peak, approximately 100-300 Myr after the family-forming event, Flora family members filled NEO space with nearly 1000 D &gt; 1 km diameter bodies before fading to its present contribution of 35-50 such NEOs. Accordingly, it is not currently a major source of large NEOs or impactors. Overall, 700-950 and 35-47 kilometer-sized asteroids struck the Earth and Moon from the Flora family, respectively, most within the first 300 Myr after family formation. Accordingly, the Flora family was a major source of terrestrial planet impactors to both the mid-Proterozoic Earth and Amazonian-era Mars, with potentially interesting implications for each world in terms of the evolution of their biospheres.", "title": ["Forming the Flora Family: Implications for the Near-Earth Asteroid Population and Large Terrestrial Planet Impactors"], "year": "2018"}

We interpret our data together with previously published JHK measurements, in all a sample of 151 asteroids, and present the results in J-H vs H-K diagrams for all taxonomic types. We find a very wide range in J-H for M-type asteroids and a distinct separation for the S and A classes, as well as a less well pronounced division for D-type asteroids. For some 10 asteroids we propose new types or changes in the classification using JHK colours and the newly available IRAS albedo data (D.

Information about the albedo and size distribution of the NEAs is an essential prerequisite for exploring their physical nature, thermal properties, mineralogy, taxonomy and for developing reliable NEA population models. In support of the ExploreNEOs campaign of the Warm Spitzer program, we will present initial results from study of a sample of NEAs using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope [Programs 88 and 91- Extinct Comets and Low-Albedo Asteroids]. These data were reduced with Spitzer IRS Custom Extraction (SPICE) a JAVA-based tool built for interactive extraction of Spitzer IRS spectra. The 5.2-38 m thermal emission spectra[R 60-130] have been fitted with models of the thermal continuum employing the Near Earth Asteroid Thermal Model [NEATM](Harris 1998) and a Thermophysical model.

{"abstract": "Small near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) (&lt;20 m) are interesting, because they are progenitors for meteorites in our terrestrial collection. The physical characteristics of these small NEAs are crucial to our understanding of the effectiveness of our atmosphere in filtering low-strength impactors. In the past, the characterization of small NEAs has been a challenge, because of the difficulty in detecting them prior to close Earth flyby. In this study, we physically characterized the 2 m diameter NEA 2015 TC25 using ground-based optical, near-infrared and radar assets during a close flyby of the Earth (distance 128,000 km) in 2015 October 12. Our observations suggest that its surface composition is similar to aubrites, a rare class of high-albedo differentiated meteorites. Aubrites make up only 0.14% of all known meteorites in our terrestrial meteorite collection. 2015 TC25 is also a very fast rotator with a period of 133 \u00b1 6 s. We combined the spectral and dynamical properties of 2015 TC25 and found the best candidate source body in the inner main belt to be the 70 km diameter E-type asteroid (44) Nysa. We attribute the difference in spectral slope between the two objects to the lack of regolith on the surface of 2015 TC25. Using the albedo of E-type asteroids (50%-60%) we refine the diameter of 2015 TC25 to 2 m, making it one of the smallest NEAs ever to be characterized.", "title": ["Physical Characterization of \u223c2 M Diameter Near-Earth Asteroid 2015 TC25: A Possible Boulder from E-type Asteroid (44) Nysa"], "year": "2016"}
{"abstract": "The Hera mission is in development within the ESA Space Safety Program for launch in October 2024 with a Falcon 9 rocket. It will perform a rendezvous with the binary asteroid (65803) Didymos in early 2027 and investigate it over 6 months [1]. Together with the NASA DART mission [2], Hera will contribute to the first asteroid deflection test. DART successfully impacted Dimorphos, the 150 m-sized moon of Didymos [3]. The DART impact resulted in a decrease of 33mn from the initial 11h55mn orbital period of Dimorphos around Didymos [4]. Although DART was extremely successful, many questions remain open about the interpretation of its outcome and the full validation of the numerical impact models: (1) What is Dimorphos' mass? Mass is needed for an actual determination of DART momentum transfer efficiency [5]. (2) Is Dimorphos a monolith covered with gravel and boulders or, as currently assumed, an aggregate? This has great influence on the DART impact outcome interpretation. (3) What is Dimorphos' final state, i.e., what is the size of the crater left by the DART impact or was Dimorphos globally or in large parts reshaped? (4) What is the final binary system's dynamical state? All this knowledge is crucial to fully validate impact models and to have an unbiased interpretation of the DART impact outcome. Other questions relate to the thermal and mineralogical properties as well as the potential presence of dust in the close environment of the binary system. Answering these questions is the goal of Hera that will perform the first asteroid binary rendezvous. Hera will also answer key questions regarding the formation of small asteroid binaries and small body geophysics in general. The spacecraft carries 5 instruments including 2 framing cameras, a hyperspectral imager, a laser altimeter, a thermal-IR imager from JAXA, and 2 Cubesats: Juventas, dedicated to asteroid geophysics, including direct measurements of internal properties for the first time, and Milani, dedicated to mineralogy and dust investigation. Hera will also perform the first Cubesat landing on such a small body, providing information on the surface mechanical response in its very low gravity environment. The development is ongoing nominally and the working groups of the Hera Science Team are working intensively, adjusting their investigations to account for the new and important results provided by DART and LICIAcube data.

Both of them are small near earth asteroids, and they actually approach the earth quite closely. Hayabusa was launched in 2003, arrived at Itokawa in 2005, and returned to the earth in 2010. We were able to have the surface materials of Itokawa. Hayabusa2 was launched in 2014 and arrived at Ryugu in June 2018. Hayabusa2 has completed its missions at Ryugu and it has left Ryugu in November 2019. Hayabusa2 is now on the way back to the earth. The earth return will be at the end of 2020. By these missions, we have come to know a lot of interesting features related small near earth asteroids. Itokawa is a 500m-sized S-type asteroid. We were surprised to see that the surface of Itokawa was covered by numerous boulders. This was the first time that we saw such surface of asteroids. One of the important discoveries by the remote sensing observations of Hayabusa was that Itokawa was not a single rock but it was a rubble pile. We were able to get the surface materials of Itokawa, and by analyzing them we found some information related to the early stage of the solar system and the evolution of Itokawa. We confirmed that Itokawa is one of the parent bodies of Ordinary chondrites that fall on the earth and we also leaned the effects of the space weathering. Ryugu is a C-type asteroid with the size of about 1000m. Its shape is like a spinning top, which was totally unexpected. Hayabusa2 was the first spacecraft that explored a spinning-top-shaped asteroid. The surface of Ryugu is also covered by numerous boulders, and there are no wide flat areas, which made touchdown quite difficult. We have obtained a lot of data by the remote sensing observations by onboard instruments, by the observations by rovers and a lander, by the two touchdown operations, and by the impact experiment. Now we have understood many interesting features of Ryugu. If we get the surface materials on our hand, then we will analyze them to find organic matters. Such organic matters could be the original material for the life on the earth, and to study such organic matters is the main purpose of Hayabusa2.", "title": ["The nature of small near earth asteroids unraveled by Hayabusa and Hayabusa2"], "year": "2021"}

It is comprised of a primary component 400-500 meters in diameter and a possibly asynchronous secondary about one-fourth that size. The most striking characteristics of this system are a significant mutual-orbit eccentricity of ~0.45, one of the largest eccentricities known among near-Earth binaries, and an implied density greater than 3 g/cc (depending on the volumes of the components). The size ratio, the semimajor axis of ~1.5 km, and the mutual-orbit period of ~26.3 h are otherwise typical among near-Earth binaries. Optical lightcurves suggest rapid rotation of the primary in of order 3 h, consistent with radar echo bandwidths, and confirm the mutual-orbit period via the timing of mutual events. Near- and thermal infrared (0.8-4.1 microns) spectroscopy with SpeX on the NASA IRTF places this system in the S complex, and rotationally resolved spectra show no variation in thermal properties as the primary rotates.

{"abstract": "The NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) 15 mission was focused on evaluating techniques for exploring near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). It began with a University of Delaware autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systematically mapping the coral reef for hundreds of meters surrounding the Aquarius habitat. This activity is akin to the type of \"far-field survey\" approach that may be used by a robotic precursor in advance of a human mission to a NEA. Data from the far-field survey were then examined by the NEEMO science team and follow-up exploration traverses were planned, which used Deepworker single-person submersibles. Science traverses at NEEMO 15 were planned according to a prioritized list of objectives developed by the science team. These objectives were based on review and discussion of previous related marine science research, including previous marine science saturation missions conducted at the Aquarius habitat. AUV data were used to select several areas of scientific interest. The Deepworker science traverses were then executed at these areas of interest during 4 days of the NEEMO 15 mission and provided higher resolution data such as coral species distribution and mortality. These traverses are analogous to the \"near-field survey\" approach that is expected to be performed by a Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV) during a human mission to a NEA before extravehicular activities (EVAs) are conducted. In addition to the science objectives that were pursued, the NEEMO 15 traverses provided an opportunity to test newly developed software and techniques. Sample collection and instrument deployment on the NEA surface by EVA crew would follow the \"near-field survey\" in a human NEA mission. Sample collection was not necessary for the purposes of the NEEMO science objectives; however, the engineering and operations objectives during NEEMO 15 were to evaluate different combinations of vehicles, crew members, tools, and equipment that could be used to perform these science objectives on a NEA. Specifically, the productivity and acceptability of simulated NEA exploration activities were systematically quantified and compared when operating with different combinations of crew sizes and exploration systems including MMSEVs, EVA jet packs, and EVA translation devices.

{"abstract": "\"Where do meteorites come from?\" has been an enduring question in planetary science, placing \"traceability\" (e.g. sample return) at the forefront of current exploration. Towards this goal, orbits for 2 dozen recovered meteorite falls have been determined by dedicated teams over many decades. Herewith we now add the orbits for more than 1000 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) for which we have telescopic spectral measurements [1] sufficient to make meteorite analog assessments. For hundreds of these NEAs, their meteorite analogs have a high degree of confidence to specific classes (e.g. H, L, LL chondrites) based on detailed mineralogical modeling [2] tested against the ground truth from the Hayabusa mission [3]. As independent variables, we correlate each NEA's meteorite analog with its dynamical source region derived from the models by Granvik et al. [4,5] accounting for Yarkovsky drift and resonance delivery efficiencies. When ratioed to the overall flux rate for the diffusion of main-belt asteroids into the inner solar system, distinct source region signatures emerge for all major meteorite classes. Most interestingly, a high degree of correlation is found with respect to the compositional gradient in the asteroid belt [6,7], with the most primitive classes preferring an outer belt or Jupiter Family Comet origin. We integrate all of these results together into a new \"Big Picture\" view of where the major classes of meteorites come from.

{"abstract": "Delay-Doppler radar observations of numerous near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) since 1999 have revealed many small groups of radar-bright pixels in some of the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) images obtained at Arecibo and Goldstone. Many of the spots remain observable as the asteroids rotate through tens of degrees. The bright pixels are not receiver noise, self noise, or artifacts, but are real features. Clusters of bright pixels appear primarily in high-resolution radar images with resolutions of 4-19 m/pixel and usually span a few rows and columns or less, indicating that these are surface features a few tens of meters in extent or smaller. Many clusters appear near the trailing edges of the images and are adjacent to and up range from radar shadows, implying the presence of small-scale topography. To date, small groups of bright pixels have been seen on at least ten NEAs observed at high resolution, such as (in chronological order of radar detection) (101955) Bennu, (33342) 1998 WT_{24}, (100085) 1992 UY_{4}, (374851) 2006 VV_{2}, (341843) 2008 EV_{5}, (136849) 1998 CS_{1}, (308635) 2005 YU_{55}, (214869) 2007 PA_{8}, (4179) Toutatis, and 2014 BR_{57}. Of these objects, Toutatis is the largest, with a long axis of 4.6 km, and 2004 BR_{57} is the smallest, with a diameter of about 80 m. These objects also span a considerable dynamic range of shapes, spin states, and spectral classes. <P />What causes the radar-bright pixels? Radar albedo correlates positively with increasing near-surface density, so relatively bright echoes can result from scattering off surface and near-surface features with higher densities than their surroundings. Bright echoes can also be generated by specular reflections from relatively flat surfaces oriented nearly perpendicular to the radar line-of-sight. Many of these features are located near the radar terminator where the radar line-of-sight is at grazing incidence angles, which tends to highlight small-scale topography. We suggest that a plausible interpretation for these particular observations is that the bright pixels are echoes from surface and near-surface boulders, which have been seen on each of the three near-Earth asteroids imaged by spacecraft: (433) Eros (NEAR-Shoemaker), (25143) Itokawa (Hayabusa), and (4179) Toutatis (Chang'e 2). These asteroids have also been imaged by radar, but the resolutions and/or signal-to-noise ratios were insufficient to reveal possible boulders. Bright spots were not evident in radar images of Toutatis obtained between 1992-2008, but following an upgrade in Goldstone's finest resolution from 19 to 4 m/pixel in 2010, a modest number of spots became visible in Goldstone images of Toutatis obtained in 2012. The prevalence of small radar bright spots on numerous NEAs establishes that features consistent with boulders can be detected in delay-Doppler radar images of particularly high-SNR targets and that these features are relatively common on near-Earth asteroid surfaces.", "title": ["Arecibo and Goldstone radar evidence for boulders on near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2014"}

These perturbations include non-uniform gravity from the asteroid, third-body disturbances from the Sun, and solar radiation pressure. For small natural (1 cm-15 m) and artificial satellites, solar radiation pressure is the primary perturbation that will cause their orbits to go unstable. For the asteroid Bennu, the future target of the spacecraft OSIRIS-REx, the possibility of natural satellites having stable orbits around the asteroid and characterize these stable regions is investigated. It has been found that the main orbital phenomena responsible for the stability or instability of these possible natural satellites are Sun-synchronous orbits, the modified Laplace plane, and the Kozai resonance. These findings are applied to other asteroids as well as to artificial satellites. The re-emission of solar radiation pressure through BYORP is also investigated for binary asteroid systems. Specifically, the BYORP force is combined with the Laplace plane such that BYORP expands the orbit of the binary system along the Laplace surface where the secondary increases in inclination. For obliquities from 68.875\u00b0 - 111.125\u00b0 the binary will eventually extend into the Laplace instability region, where the eccentricity of the orbit will increase. A subset of the instability region leads to eccentricities high enough that the secondary will impact the primary. This result inspired the development of a hypothesis of a contact-binary binary cycle described briefly in the following. YORP will increase the spin rate of a contact binary while also driving the spin-pole to an obliquity of 90\u00b0. Eventually, the contact binary will fission. The binary will subsequently become double-synchronous, thus allowing the BYORP acceleration to have secular effects on the orbit. The orbit will then expand along the Laplace surface to the Laplace plane instability region eventually leading to an impact and the start of a new cycle with the YORP process.", "title": ["Natural and Artificial Satellite Dynamics and Evolution around Near-Earth Asteroids with Solar Radiation Pressure"], "year": "2018"}
{"abstract": "The near-Earth object population, composed mostly of asteroids rather than comets, poses an impact hazard to Earth. Space technology is reaching a sufficient level of capability and maturity where the deflection of an Earth impactor may be possible within the next decades. The paper focuses on assessing the maximum deflection capability (minimum response time) that could be achieved with a rendezvous/landed spacecraft, using electric propulsion and nuclear/solar power technologies likely to be available in the near-term, within the constraints of a single heavy launch into low Earth orbit. Preliminary design concepts are presented for large, high-power nuclear and solar electric spacecraft, based on a trade-off analysis of power/ propulsion technology options and an optimisation of the complete mission design to the minimise the total response time for a representative impactor/deflection scenario. High specific impulse gridded-ion engines show significantly improved mission performance over Hall effect thrusters due to the high delta-V requirements for Earth spiral out, rendezvous, spin axis re-orientation and deflection. Amorphous silicon thin film solar arrays perform substantially better than conventional high cell efficiency alternatives. It was found that solar electric spacecraft could achieve lower total response times for the deflection than a nuclear electric spacecraft of the same initial mass, if the asteroid perihelion is much lower than the Earth. The comparison is expected to be much closer if the asteroid perihelion is near the Earth. Both systems were found to provide effective deflection capabilities for small/moderate-size impactors.", "title": ["Concepts for Near-Earth Asteroid Deflection using Spacecraft with Advanced Nuclear and Solar Electric Propulsion Systems"], "year": "2005"}

{"abstract": "No accurate estimate of the orbital and absolute magnitude distribution of the Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) currently exists, largely because: (i) the known NEOs are biased by complicated observational selection effects which favor the discovery of bright or large objects that come close to Earth; (ii) relatively few NEOs have been discovered, making debiasing efforts difficult; (iii) NEO orbits are chaotic on short timescales (&lt; 1000 years); and (iv) the source regions and replenishment mechanisms for the NEOs are not well understood. For these reasons, observers are still struggling to increase NEO detection rates, while the interpretation of existing data continues to be problematic. We propose a new method to attack this problem, one which takes advantage of theoretical advances and new numerical tools. To treat observational biases, we have applied a model-independent, semi-analytical method for calculating the probability that an asteroid observation program will find a given asteroid in a (a, e, i, and H; semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, and absolute magnitude, respectively) bin per square degree at opposition at the Vernal Equinox (Jedicke and Metcalfe 1998). To discover how NEOs are replenished, we have used symplectic numerical integration techniques which can track the orbital paths of test bodies started in several potential NEO source regions (e.g., 3:1 resonance, v_6 resonance, multiple weak mean-motion resonances). By merging the observational biases with these NEO dynamical ``roadmaps\" (and an NEO absolute magnitude distribution), we get a probability distribution which, if the sources have been weighted correctly, can be directly compared to the known NEOs. By testing a range of possible source combinations, we have produced a ``best-fit'' distribution which not only yields the normalized and debiased NEO orbital and absolute magnitude distribution (over various NEO sizes) but also the relative importance of each NEO replenishment source. These results have several important applications for NEO observers and for studies of the impact rates of asteroids onto the terrestrial planets. These issues are discussed in an abstract by Morbidelli et al. (this issue).", "title": ["Understanding the Distribution of Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "1999"}
{"abstract": "I have been tracking progress of the surveys discovering Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) for more than 20 years, and have reported updates every few years at past meetings. Following my last report at a DPS and the published update two years ago (Harris and D\u2019Abramo 2015, Icarus 257, 302-312), it came to light that these and previous estimates were affected by round-off of H magnitudes by the Minor Planet Center to 0.1 mag. While it is true that individual magnitudes are generally not even that accurate, statistically the round-off shifted the population estimate by ~6%. While this hardly matters in the small size range, for the largest asteroids the shift alters N(H&lt;17.75), assumed equivalent to N(D&gt;1km), from 990 \u00b1 20 (Harris &amp; D\u2019Abramo 2015) to 934 \u00b1 20.

{"abstract": "The primary goal of this project is to characterize the surface composition (and other properties such as radius, albedo and thermal inertia) of a sample of low perihelion Near- Earth Asteroids (NEAs), based on their 7 to 14 micron spectrum. NEAs with low perihelion distances represent a unique laboratory in which to study the effects of thermal processing on asteroid surfaces. We will study the mineral and organic composition of our targets and we will search for correlations between the mid-infrared spectral characteristics and other properties such as size, albedo, rotational properties and orbital characteristics. Understanding how asteroid surfaces change as a result of exposure to high temperatures will help constrain models of the compositional and thermal environment in the region of the protoplanetary disk where the asteroids formed. Part of the motivation to study the low perihelion NEAs comes from the results of our recent study of 3200 Phaethon (Licandro et al. 2007), where we found indications that the surface mineralogy of this low perihelion NEA may have been altered by the perihelion thermal pulse.

{"abstract": "Abstract (2,250 Maximum Characters): Direct estimates of the Yarkovsky effect on near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) indicate that detectable semimajor axis drift rates are approximately 2-4 times more likely to be negative than positive (Nugent et al., AJ 144, 2012; Farnocchia et al., Icarus in press, 2013). The Yarkovsky effect induces a semimajor axis drift rate that is proportional to the cosine of the obliquity, and thus the excess of negative drift rates suggests an excess of retrograde rotation among the NEAs. This reinforces an earlier result from light curve inversion techniques (La Spina et al., Nature 428, 2004). The retrograde excess is presumed to arise from the nu6 resonance, which is situated near the inner edge of the main belt. Main-belt asteroids that are Yarkovsky-driven into the near-Earth region via the nu6 resonance must have a negative semimajor axis drift and therefore retrograde rotation, leading to an overabundance of retrograde rotators, even though other source regions may have parity between retrograde and direct rotators. The Yarkovsky detections do not directly shed light on the relative presence of mid-range obliquities, which tend to have low drift rates and therefore fail to yield statistically significant drift estimates, but they do present significantly different selection effects when compared to light curve inversions. We present preliminary results from our effort to derive independent constraints on the obliquity distribution of NEAs based on the distribution of estimated semimajor axis drift rates among the NEA population and their associated uncertainties. Our approach to solving the inverse problem starts by deriving the drift rates and associated signal-to-noise ratios for a semi-synthetic NEA population that assumes a parameterized obliquity distribution. The parameters are adjusted until the simulated distributions match the observed distributions, yielding not only an estimated distribution, but also uncertainties and correlations among the relevant model parameters. The results have the potential to offer constraints on the spin axis evolution of NEAs after they enter the near-Earth region.", "title": ["The Obliquity Distribution of Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2013"}

{"abstract": "It is widely accepted that Near- Earth Asteroids (NEAs) represent a global hazard for human civilization. They have impacted many bodies in the Solar System, including the Earth. More notorious was the NEA with an estimated diameter of 17 meters that exploded over Chelyabinsk in Russia with an energy of about 470 kilotons in 2013 and injured over 1,500 people. Due to the possible devastating consequences of such impacts, Congress has assigned NASA the task of finding 90% of all of the asteroids with sizes greater than 140 meters by 2020. While is of vital importance and priority to detect these objects, it is also of vital importance to characterize them in order to develop a correct deflection strategy in case of an imminent impact.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are a diverse population of objects derived from the main asteroid belt with a wide range of sizes, shapes, compositions and biases in how efficiently they are delivered to near-Earth space. Radar observations provide a powerful tool for observing and characterizing NEAs that pass within a volume of space accessible to the Arecibo telescope and close to Earth (typically less than 0.1 au). This set of NEAs has different selection biases than many other surveys, and so the distribution of properties provides a new perspective. Continuous wave (CW) observations of NEAs provide initial estimates of apparent rotation rate and radar reflectivity as well as astrometry for orbit refinement.

{"abstract": "The reflectance spectrum (0.33 - 1.0(mu)m) of 17 near-Earth asteroids were measured telescopically with a photoelectric photometer. Mineralogical intepretation assuming cosmically abundant material is based on crystal field theory. The surface composition of these asteroids (with one exception) contains olivine, pyroxene, phyllosilicates and opaques (which cannot be mineralogically identified). These spectra have stronger absorptions than that of most main belt asteroids. 2201 1947XC cannot be interpreted in terms of common minerals. Cometary emission features may explain the spectrum. The mineralogical interpretation of near-Earth asteroids addresses three questions: (1) What are their source regions? (2) What is their relation to meteorites? (3) Are they potential extra-terrestrial resources?. Analogues exist in proposed source regions: near Kirkwood gaps, (/(,6) resonance, and the Flora family. Additional data are needed to confirm similarity of surface composition suggested by similar reflectance spectra. Analogues include: 1580 Betulia and 2 Pallas, 1685 Toro and 349 Dembowska, and 1915 Quetzalcoatl and 4 Vesta. These compositions may be common among unmeasured, small asteroids. The existing data suggest all regions proposed on dynamical grounds, except the 2:1 Kirkwood gap and Mars-crossers (which have not been adequately sampled), may be source regions. Two compositions are suggestive of cometary origin. Others do not agree with the assumption that comets are dirty iceballs.

There are no irons, stony-irons, nor carbonaceous chondrites type 1 or 2. Many achondrites are not represented. The low frequency of ordinary chondrite compositions compared to the meteorites is consistent with the hypothesis that a few parent bodies located in dynamically favorable regions supply 90% of meteorite falls. The number of non-meteoritic analogues is consistent with the recently discovered diversity of meteorites. The absence of nickel -irons supports observed cosmic ray exposure age and dynamical models predicting sources with longer mean life times than near-Earth asteroids.

{"abstract": "High resolution imagery and a three-dimensional characterization of Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) can be obtained with ground-based radars. The Arecibo and Goldstone radar systems yield data at spatial resolutions comparable to the highest resolution spacecraft images of asteroids obtained to date. The use of radar interferometry techniques can further improve imaging and shape reconstruction algorithms [1],[2] and may allow direct measurements of the topography of NEAs. A two-element radar interferometer of appropriate baseline provides an observable, the interferometric phase, which can be used to extract three-dimensional information about the target [3], hence giving additional control in shape modeling procedures. The measurement of interferometric phase also opens the possibility of mapping the topography of an asteroid, in a manner similar to that applied recently to the Moon [4]. Simulations show that this is feasible when potential ambiguities in range-Doppler imaging are avoided, for instance when elongated objects are in a favorable orientation. Radar interferometric imaging of 6489 Golevka was attempted during its June 1999 close approach to Earth [5]. The Arecibo 305 m telescope was used to transmit, and the DSN 70 m antenna in Madrid formed the second element of the interferometer.

{"abstract": "We report radar and optical photometric observations of near-Earth asteroid (214869) 2007 PA8 obtained during October 2-November 13, 2012. We observed 2007 PA8 on sixteen days with Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) and on five days with the 0.6 m telescope at Table Mountain Observatory. Closest approach was on November 5 at a distance of 0.043 au. Images obtained with Goldstone's new chirp system achieved range resolutions as fine as 3.75 m, placing thousands of pixels on the asteroid's surface, and revealing that 2007 PA8 is an elongated, asymmetric object. Surface features include angularities, facets, and a concavity approximately 400 m in diameter. We used the Shape software to estimate the asteroid's 3D shape and spin state. 2007 PA8 has a broad, rounded end and a tapered, angular end with sharp-crested ridges. The asteroid's effective diameter is 1.35 \u00b1 0.07 km, which in combination with the absolute magnitude of 16.30 \u00b1 0.52 gives an optical albedo of p<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.29 \u00b1 0.14. The shape modeling of the radar data revealed that 2007 PA8 is a non-principal axis (NPA) rotator in the short-axis mode with an average period of precession by the long axis around the angular momentum vector of 4.26 \u00b1 0.02 days and an oscillatory period around the long axis of 20.55 \u00b1 3.75 days. The amplitude of rolling around the long axis is 42 \u00b1 7\u00b0 . The angular momentum vector points toward ecliptic longitude and latitude of 273.6 \u00b1 10\u00b0, +16.9 \u00b1 5\u00b0. 2007 PA8 is only the second confirmed short-axis mode NPA rotator known in the near-Earth asteroid population after (99942) Apophis (Pravec et al., 2014). 2007 PA8 has a geopotential high at the equator, where the equator is defined as the plane that contains the long and intermediate axis. This geopotential extreme could be interpreted as a large, hidden surface depression, or as evidence that 2007 PA8 is a multi-component body.", "title": ["Goldstone radar evidence for short-axis mode non-principal-axis rotation of near-Earth asteroid (214869) 2007 PA8"], "year": "2017"}
{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroid 2012 TC4 approached within 0.00035 au (6.9 Earth radii of Earth's surface) on 2017 October 12. This was one of the closest near-Earth asteroid encounters known in advance and it provided an outstanding opportunity to investigate this object's physical properties. Here we report radar observations obtained between Oct. 9-14 with the 70 m DSS-14 and 34 m DSS-13 antennas the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex and with the 100 m Green Bank Telescope. 2012 TC4 has an absolute magnitude of 27, suggesting a diameter within a factor of two of 15 meters. Despite its diminutive size, the flyby was so close that we expected to observe extremely strong radar signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) that would permit imaging at the highest range resolutions currently attainable at Goldstone. Monostatic detection of the asteroid occurred at DSS-14 (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) on October 9 but at weaker SNRs than expected, possibly indicating that the diameter was significantly smaller than 15 meters. Monostatic DSS-14 delay-Doppler imaging on Oct. 11 at 3.75 m resolution placed only two range pixels on the object. The highest resolution images were obtained on Oct. 12 when transmissions were at DSS-13 (7190 MHz, 4.2 cm) and reception was at Green Bank. The images achieved a range resolution of 1.875 m/pixel that is the finest ever obtained at Goldsone for any near-Earth asteroid. The images reveal an elongated, angular, asymmetric, and rapidly rotating object and place lower bounds on its long and intermediate axes of about 6 x 12 meters. The rotation evident in the images is consistent with the 12 minute period that is prominent in the lightcurves obtained by W. B. Ryan (pers. comm.). The ratio of same-sense circular (SC) to opposite-sense circular (OC) polarization, SC/OC, is about 0.6, which probably indicates that this object has an unusually rough surface at decimeter spatial scales. Circular polarization ratios have been obtained for hundreds of near Earth asteroids, and the ratio for 2012 TC4 overlaps the upper end of the values reported for C- and SQ-class NEAs and the lower end for E- and V-class objects. Combined with an effective diameter in the realm of 7-10 meters, the implication is that 2012 TC4 is an optically-bright object. The radar images are suitable for estimation of the 3D shape and spin state, which may have changed due to tides during the extremely close approach. When combined with the area/mass ratio estimated independently from orbit fitting (D. Farnocchia, pers. comm.), the physical model will be used to obtain the mass and the bulk density, information that is generally not available for solar system objects in this size regime.", "title": ["Radar Observations of Near-Earth Asteroid 2012 TC4"], "year": "2018"}

{"abstract": "Asteroid mining has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of in-space manufacturing, production of propellant for space transportation and consumables for crewed spacecraft, compared to launching the required resources from the Earth's deep gravity well. This paper discusses the top-level mission architecture and trajectory design for these resource-return missions, comparing high-thrust trajectories with continuous low-thrust solar-sail trajectories. The paper focuses on maximizing the economic Net Present Value, which takes the time-cost of finance into account and therefore balances the returned resource mass and mission duration. The different propulsion methods are compared in terms of maximum economic return and sets of attainable target asteroids. Results for transporting resources to geostationary orbit show that the orbital parameter hyperspace of suitable target asteroids is considerably larger for solar sails, allowing for more flexibility in selecting potential target asteroids. Also, results show that the Net Present Value that can be realized is larger when employing solar sailing instead of chemical propulsion. In addition, it is demonstrated that a higher Net Present Value can be realized when transporting volatiles to the Lunar Gateway instead of geostationary orbit. The paper provides one more step towards making commercial asteroid mining an economically viable reality by integrating trajectory design, propulsion technology and economic modelling.", "title": ["Economic assessment of high-thrust and solar-sail propulsion for near-earth asteroid mining"], "year": "2021"}

He quickly realized that radar provided perspectives on close-approaching NEAs that were both very precise as well as complementary to traditional astrometry, enabling good predictions of future orbits and collision probabilities extending for centuries into the future. He also was among the few astronomers who considered the profound issues raised by this newly recognized hazard and by early suggestions of how to mitigate the hazard. With Carl Sagan, Ostro articulated the \"deflection dilemma\" and other potential low-probability but real dangers of mitigation technologies that might be more serious than the low-probability impact hazard itself. Yet Ostro maintained a deep interest in developing responsible mitigation technologies, in educating the public about the nature of the impact hazard, and in learning more about the population of threatening bodies, especially using the revealing techniques of delay-doppler radar mapping of NEAs and their satellites.", "title": ["Steve Ostro and the Near-Earth Asteroid Impact Hazard"], "year": "2009"}

{"abstract": "This study investigates the preliminary trajectory design for high-thrust missions to near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), considering distance and phase angle constraints during the approaching phase to enable pre-rendezvous optical navigation and the scientific identification of asteroids. A global optimization algorithm called monotonic basin hopping is used to design \u0394v-optimal impulsive trajectories both with and without constraints. Comparisons reveal that extending the final leg of the unconstrained reference trajectory and incorporating a few deep-space maneuvers in that final leg can yield a constrained trajectory with a \u0394v increase of only a few percent. The effects of the phase angle and minimum distance constraint on \u0394v are also examined. The results indicate that in \u0394v-optimal constrained trajectories, an additional deep-space maneuver enables the redistribution of maneuvers in the last leg to ideally insert the spacecraft into the constraint cone. However, additional small maneuvers may be necessary at times to ensure that the spacecraft remains within the cone. Based on these findings, we present a two-step approach for the preliminary design of constrained trajectories for NEA missions based on global optimization algorithms. This approach serves as a valuable tool for initial mission design and trade-off analyses involving constraints, fuel usage, and transfer durations.", "title": ["Analysis of Preliminary Impulsive Trajectory Design for Near-Earth Asteroid Missions under Approaching Phase Constraints"], "year": "2023"}

{"abstract": "We report radar observations of near-Earth asteroid 2004 BL86 obtained during 2015 Jan. 26-31 at the 70 m and 34 m Goldstone facilities, Arecibo, Green Bank, and elements of the Very Long Baseline Array. 2004 BL86 approached within 0.0080 au (3.1 lunar distances) on Jan. 26, the closest known approach by any object with an absolute magnitude brighter than ~19 until 2027. Prior to the encounter, virtually nothing was known about its physical properties other than its absolute magnitude of 19, which suggested a diameter within a factor of two of 500 m. Due to its size and the extremely close approach, 2004 BL86 was a very strong radar target that provided an outstanding opportunity for radar imaging and physical characterization. The radar images confirmed photometric results reported by Pravec et al. (2015, CBET 4063) that 2004 BL86 is a binary system. This is the 43<SUP>rd</SUP> near-Earth asteroid binary detected by radar. Delay-Doppler images placed thousands of 3.75 m-resolution pixels on the object and reveal a rounded and oblate primary with an equatorial diameter of ~300 m, suggesting it is optically-bright, evidence for ridges, small-scale topography including boulders, and a large angular feature near one of the poles.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth Asteroids (10302) 1989 ML and (4660) Nereus have attracted much attention as candidates for deep space explorations of the next generation. In the study, the maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE) and MEGNO index (Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits) are calculated after considering the effects of major objects of the Solar system and the stability of these two asteroids are discussed. For each asteroid, 1000 clonal particles are generated from a multivariate normal distribution within the observational uncertainties. The statistical results display probable motion regions of each asteroid within 0.1 million years, and provide distributions of occurrence times in the phase space of semi-major axis versus eccentricity, and count probability of close encounters and collisions between asteroid and Earth or other planets. Further, secular resonance, Kozai resonance and mean motion resonance are analyzed for nominal orbits of the two asteroids. By these analyses above, we concluded that 1989 ML is in the region dominated by mean motion resonances with terrestrial planets, and the probability of close encounters with them is relatively small. Therefore, its orbit is relatively stable. For Nereus, it is located in the close-encounter region of the Earth with an extremely unstable orbit.", "title": ["Analysis of Orbital Characteristics and Evolution of Near-Earth Asteroids (10302) 1989 ML and (4660) Nereus"], "year": "2021"}
{"abstract": "The orbit of small-sized asteroids can be affected by non-gravitational perturbations. When this happens, non-gravitational forces need to be taken into account since they are as important as collisions and gravitational perturbations for the overall understanding of the asteroid orbital evolution.The Yarkovsky effect and the Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP) are non-gravitational perturbations that can be modelled knowing the physical properties of asteroids, and whose consequences of the motions can be measured from accurate astrometry.The knowledge of the physical properties of asteroids is usually not sufficient to produce the thermophysical models needed for the computation of the Yarkovsky acceleration. Nevertheless, it can often be measured as a semimajor axis drift if the astrometric dataset contains extremely accurate observations (e.g. radar data), or if the observations span a sufficiently long time interval.Farnocchia et al. 2013 list 21 NEAs with a measurable semimajor-axis drift. Since 2013, the number of asteroids for which it is possible to detect the Yarkovsky effect has grown. This is due to the increased quality and time span of the observations, and to new radar measurements that have since become available. We are able to detect the Yarkovsky effect for more than 40 NEAs, employing a high precision dynamical model, including the Newtonian attraction of 16 massive asteroids and the planetary relativistic terms, and a suitable astrometric data treatment. We present a list of objects with a significant detection of Yarkovksy effect and a value compatible with the Yarkovsky mechanism.The computed non-gravitational perturbations will be added to the web portal of the ESA SSA-NEO Coordination Centre, highlighting the fact that the orbit has been computed taking the Yarkovsky effect or the SRP into account. The inclusion of non-gravitational perturbations can also affect the results of the impact monitoring, as in the case of (410777) 2009 FD, (29075) 1950 DA, (99942) Apophis and (101555) Bennu.", "title": ["Detection of Yarkovsky effect and solar radiation pressure on Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2016"}
{"abstract": "In response to the problem that ground-based optical monitoring systems cannot monitor near-Earth asteroids which are too close to the Sun on the celestial sphere, we raise a method that tracks and determines the orbit of asteroids by Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO) platforms with optical monitoring. Through data filtering by visibility analysis and the initial orbit information of the asteroids provided by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the asteroids' orbits are determined and compared with the reference orbit. Simulation results show that with a measurement accuracy of two arcseconds and an arc length of three years, the orbit determination accuracy of the DRO platform for near-Earth asteroids selected in the simulation example can reach tens of kilometers, especially the asteroids with Atira orbits to an accuracy of fewer than ten kilometers.

For a precise designed trajectory, a full ephemeris dynamical model, which includes gravities of the Sun, the planets and the Moon, is adopted by reading the JPL ephemeris. The departure time, arrival time, burning time duration and thrust angles are set as variables to be designed and optimized.

The baseline target of MarcoPolo-R is the binary NEA (175706) 1996 FG3, which offers an efficient operational and technical mission profile. A binary target also provides enhanced science return. The choice of a binary target allows several scientific investigations to occur more easily than through a single object, in particular regarding the fascinating geology and geophysics of asteroids. MarcoPolo-R will rendezvous with a primitive, organic-rich NEA, scientifically characterize it at multiple scales, and return a bulk sample to Earth for laboratory analyses. The MarcoPolo-R sample will provide a representative sample from the surface of a known asteroid with known geologic context, and will contribute to the inventory of primitive material that is probably missing from the meteorite collection. The MarcoPolo-R samples will thus contribute to the exploration of the origin of planetary materials and initial stages of habitable planet formation, to the identification and characterization of the organics and volatiles in a primitive asteroid and to the understanding of the unique geomorphology, dynamics and evolution of a binary asteroid that belongs to the Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA) population.", "title": ["MarcoPolo-R: Near-Earth Asteroid sample return mission selected for the assessment study phase of the ESA program cosmic vision"], "year": "2014"}

{"abstract": "The past two decades have brought a profound expansion of knowledge of near earth objects (NEO). If creatively exploited, NEOs can significantly increase human safety while reducing costs of exploration and development of the moon, Mars and the solar system. Synergistically, the ability to defend the Earth from devastating impacts will become very effective. <P />A spherical volume having a radius equivalent to the moon's orbit, 400,000 km, is visited every day by approximately ten NEOs having diameters of ~10 meters, while ~30 meter diameter encounters occur about once per month. Because these objects are usually very faint and only within detectable range for a few days, they require specialized equipment to discover them with high probability of detection and to enable accurate determination of orbital parameters. Survey systems are now being implemented that are cataloging many thousands of objects larger than 30 meters, but numerous advantages will result from extending the complete NEO census down to 10 meter diameters. The typical compositions of such NEOs will range from ~80% that are low density dust &amp; rock ``rubble piles'' to perhaps 2% containing heavy metals-properties well known from meteorite samples. It is quite possible that there will also be some fragments of short period comets that are rich in water ice and other volatile components. <P />In this paper we will propose a set of new technologies and strategies for exploiting NEO resources that can yield important space development breakthroughs at much lower costs than existing concepts. Solar powered ``Tugboats'' deployed at the space station can rendezvous with carefully selected NEOs and steer them into captured orbits in the lunar L4 &amp; L5 regions. Robotic equipment will then modify them for a plethora of benefits. Notably, the problem of radiation shielding against the Van Allen belts, solar flares and cosmic rays will be solved. Free transportation from low earth orbit to the moon and beyond will be feasible via shielded habitats in elliptical orbits. Large, comfortable habitats for long duration trips to Mars and beyond can be built. Propulsion for orbital transfer and maneuvering of heavy payloads can be accomplished by solar energized ejection of NEO materials. Industries can be developed based upon reconditioning materials for use in space and recovery of heavy metals for use on Earth.", "title": ["New Technologies and Strategies to Exploit Near Earth Asteroids for Breakthrough Space Development"], "year": "2010"}
{"abstract": "Numerical modeling has long suggested that gravitationally-bound near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) can be destroyed by tidal forces during close and slow encounters with terrestrial planets. However, there has so far been hardly any undisputable evidence of tidal disruptions actually occuring in the innermost regions of the Solar System. We present population-level evidence for the tidal disruption of NEAs during close encounters with the Earth and Venus. A comparison between observations and model distributions for NEA orbits and absolute magnitudes shows that the models underpredict the number of NEAs with perihelion distance coinciding with the semimajor axes of Venus and the Earth. A detailed analysis of the excess NEAs shows that their characteristics agree with the prediction for tidal disruptions, and they cannot be explained by observational selection effects or orbital dynamics. Accounting for tidal disruptions in evolutionary models of the NEA population, that are calibrated with detection statistics from ongoing and planned NEA surveys, will eventually allow us to place useful constraints on asteroid interior structure, one of the main knowledge gaps in contemporary planetary science. Tidal disruptions also partly solve the long-standing puzzle of bolide-detection networks predicting more decameter-scale Earth impactors than telescopic asteroid surveys.", "title": ["Near-Earth asteroids destroyed by tidal forces during close encounters with terrestrial planets"], "year": "2023"}
{"abstract": "Radar observations of near-Earth asteroids have revealed a heterogeneous population with diameters spanning meter to kilometer scales, diverse shapes ranging from simple spheroids to extremely irregular bodies, and rotation periods stretching from minutes to weeks. Since 1998, when the Arecibo Observatory S-band radar system was upgraded to transmit up to 1 MW, over 260 near-Earth asteroids have been detected. We find the radar-observed near-Earth asteroid population with absolute magnitude H &lt; 21 is not dominated by a single category of basic shape: spheroids, multiple-asteroid systems, double-lobed contact binaries, elongated bodies, or irregularly shaped asteroids. A radar-observed binary fraction of 17% (N = 32) among near-Earth asteroids with H &lt; 21 is in agreement with optical observations, while contact binaries account for another 14% (N = 27). At smaller sizes, binaries and contact binaries are much rarer (one of each with H &lt; 21). The spin distribution of near-Earth asteroids estimated from radar matches very well with the spin distribution determined from optical lightcurves, including the curious lack of small, slowly rotating bodies despite the different biases in these observational techniques. The shape and spin distributions of near-Earth asteroids observed with radar both show a distinct change in the population around H of 21 or 22 (100- to 200-m diameters), possibly indicating fundamental structural changes at this scale.

{"abstract": "High precision orbit estimation and trajectory propagation for small solar system objects are more and more important, e.g., for linking old observations and assessing the risk of an impact. At high precision levels nongravitational perturbations cannot be neglected. The Yarkovsky effect is the most important nongravitational perturbation as it produces a secular drift in semimajor axis, thus we searched for Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) with measurable Yarkovsky signal. We modeled the related recoil force as a transverse acceleration depending on the heliocentric distance. To consistently detect the Yarkovsky effect we accounted for accelerations down to the same order of magnitude, including perturber asteroids and planetary relativistic terms. Moreover, as star catalog biases may lead to inaccurate results, we applied debiasing and weighting from Chesley et al., Icarus, 2010. We found a few tens of objects with measurable Yarkovsky effect (significant signal to noise ratio). The inclusion of the Yarkovsky perturbation allowed the recovery of observations otherwise considered as outliers. The best Yarkovsky determination allows the recovery of one radar apparition for asteroid (101955) 1999RQ36 and results in an orbit improvement by two orders of magnitude. Other remarkable cases are (1862) Apollo, with a robust Yarkovsky detection allowing the recovery of three radar observations, and (2100) Ra-Shalom. The sign of the semimajor axis drift can be related to the asteroid spin orientation and thus connected with the delivery mechanism from the most NEA feeding resonances. All three examples above are retrograde rotators. The consequences of the Yarkovsky effect on impact predictions in the next century are relevant, as in the well studied case of (101955). In the current century most possible impacts are low probability events and therefore are typically weakly affected by nongravitational perturbations, but there can be exceptions.", "title": ["Near Earth Asteroids with Measurable Yarkovsky Effect"], "year": "2012"}

In particular, terrains spectrally redder as well as terrains spectrally bluer than the average surface are newly identified by our analysis. The floors of all main craters at the surface of Ryugu appear redder than their surroundings, and are associated with a probable smaller grain size material. A large depression of the Northern hemisphere may contain bluer heterogeneities likely due to a more packed or/and fresher, subsequently deposited material.

{"abstract": "Asteroids and Comets that come close to the Earth's orbit are called Near Earth Objects (NEOs). Any dust ejected from them, meteoroid streams will formed a~meteoroid stream with orbits that are similar to that of the parent body. If the Earth passes through such a stream, the meteoroids will ablate and produce meteors that are as meteor showers. In this region, orbits evolve rapidly, hence, over time the orbits of stream meteoroids will progressively diverge both from each other and from the orbit of the parent body, so that instead of being observed as a meteor shower, these meteoroids become part of the sporadic background. <P />When a meteor shower is observed, a similarity in the orbits should indicate the parent and several test for this are discussed. If the parent is active, then it is a comet, but if no activity is found then it could either be an asteroid or a dormant comet. In this case, the behaviour of the meteor in the atmosphere will indicate whether the parent body was likely to be an asteroid or a comet. <P />For sporadic meteoroids the situation is more complicated as they can not be associated with a givenparent body. All that can be done is to classify the orbits as being of comet or asteroid origin. Several criteria have been proposed and applied to the present day orbits of sporadic meteors. Using a single criterion can introduce a serious bias into the results with the fraction of comet orbits understated by up to 29%. Two parameter criteria have been suggested to remove this bias. Using these criteria on a set of ~78000 sporadic meteoroids 66-67% have comet type orbits.

{"abstract": "In April of 2000 and again in April of 2001 radar images of near-Earth asteroid 2000 EE104 were obtained with the Arecibo Observatory planetary radar. Most of the images show a double-lobed object. However, other images clearly show that the two components are not separated. The asteroid appears to be in rigid body rotation with a period of approximately 8 hours. The pole orientation was significantly different between the two apparitions, and it is likely that the geometry is well determined from the two sets of images. The radar-determined size can be combined with the visual brightness (H=20.50) to determine an optical albedo of 0.18 +/- 0.05. However, this assumes that G=0.15, and there are indications that the scattering phase function of this object could be very unusual. The asteroid is elongated, approximately 240m in length. The axial ratio appears to be at least 2:1, although a detailed shape model has not yet been determined. The echo in the expected (opposite circular, or OC) polarization is nearly the same as in the same-circular (SC) sense: The SC/OC polarization ratio is typically 0.1--0.3 for NEAs, but is 1.1 +/- 0.3 for 2000 EE104, and varies with rotational phase.

He is now best known for the discovery of the Trojan asteroids associated with Jupiter in 1906, but was a pioneer in the application of photographic techniques to astronomy, particularly for conducting asteroid surveys. His attention to detail and perseverance also led to the discovery of the near-Earth asteroid 887 Alinda, which is the eponym of an orbital class in 3:1 resonance with Jupiter. Alinda class contains several potentially hazardous asteroids, and has been particularly instructive in development of theories of eccentricity increase for resonant asteroids. Alinda was discovered on January 3, 1918, on the very edge of one of two plates taken with the 40 cm aperture Bruce double astrograph. The inability to reduce a long trail going off the plate meant that only one month later could the object again be found with the Bruce telescope, and later observed with the follow-up instrument, the 72 cm aperture Waltz reflector. In what Wolf referred to as \"the greatest embarrassment of my life\", reflector observations had him conclude that Alinda had a satellite. At a time when plates had to be exposed for several hours, laboriously developed and analyzed, and in the case of high eccentricity objects like Alinda, predicted with inadequate theories, Wolf's persistence allowed it never to be lost. Despite this, its essential resonant nature was not determined until 1969, despite the pioneering work by Brown (1911) on resonance in the asteroid belt and the knowledge dating to the late nineteenth century work of Kirkwood that commensurabilities were important in its structure. The majority of Wolf's plates are available as online scans through the Heidelberg Digitized Astronomical Plates project of the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory, but the Alinda discovery plate, which was broken, was scanned specially.", "title": ["Max Wolf's Discovery of Near-Earth Asteroid 887 Alinda"], "year": "2016"}

{"abstract": "Scientific interest in the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population has grown in recent years, particularly with regards to characterizing the population of mission-accessible NEAs. Mission accessibility is defined by delta-v, the change in velocity required for a spacecraft to rendezvous with a celestial body. With current propulsion technology, spacecraft can reach NEAs whose orbits have delta-V &lt; 7 km/s.Across the entire NEA population, the smallest (d &lt; 1 km) objects have not been well-studied, owing to the difficulty of observing them. These very small objects are often targets of opportunity, observable for only a short period of time after their discovery. Even at their brightest (V ~ 18), these asteroids are faint enough that they must be observed with large ground-based telescopes.The Mission Accessible Near-Earth Object Survey (MANOS) began in August 2013 as a multi-year physical characterization survey that was awarded survey status by NOAO. MANOS will target several hundred mission-accessible NEOs across visible and near-infrared wavelengths, ultimately providing a comprehensive catalog of physical properties (astrometry, light curves, spectra).Thirty-seven small, mission-accessible NEAs were observed between mid 2013 and mid 2014 using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph at Gemini North &amp; South observatories. Taxonomic classifications were obtained by fitting our spectra to the visible wavelength portions of the mean reflectance spectra of the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy (DeMeo et al 2009). The smallest near-Earth asteroids are the likely progenitors of meteorites; we expect the observed fraction of ordinary chondrite meteorites to match that of their parent bodies, S-type asteroids. We present classifications for these objects as well as preliminary results for the distribution of taxa (as a proxy for composition) as a function of object size and compare to the observed fraction of ordinary chondrite meteorites.", "title": ["The Taxonomic Distribution of Mission-Accessible Small Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2014"}

{"abstract": "Achieving a soft landing over the surface of small celestial bodies is an essential maneuver in space to advance the status of space exploration, sample collecting and in-situ resource utilization, among other on-orbit tasks. Landing on these bodies is challenging due to the reduced-gravity and airless environment. The correct planning of execution of the trajectory to land on the surface of the body is of cumbersome importance to prevent the vehicle from bouncing up and eventually reach escape velocity. In this paper, a bio-inspired trajectory planning method to land on the surface of a Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) with zero relative velocity is proposed. The method is based on Tau theory, which has been demonstrated to explain the way that humans and some other animals' approach to different target spots to perform tasks such as perching, landing, and grasping. We have selected the NEA Apophis asteroid as our case study due to its accessibility, and small rotational velocity and orbit condition code. Two landing scenarios are studied; one considers the case where the satellite is hovering at a low altitude; the other corresponds to a landing maneuver right after a deorbiting or breaking phase, which may cause residual initial velocity in the vehicle prior to the landing maneuver. Once the descending trajectory is obtained, a closed-loop controller is in charge of achieving trajectory tracking and calculating the continuous and on/off thrust control signals. The simulation results show that the introduced approach can achieve zero final relative velocity in both cases for different initial condition, which is a requirement for a soft landing. Besides, different kinematic behaviors can be obtained by modifying the single variable named the Tau constant. The particular advantages of the method with respect to a commonly used approach are devised and analyzed as well.", "title": ["Bio-inspired guidance method for a soft landing on a Near-Earth Asteroid"], "year": "2020"}

{"abstract": "NASA's Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) has been proposed with the aim to capture a small asteroid a few meters in size and redirect it into an orbit around the Moon. There it can be investigated at leisure by astronauts aboard an Orion or other spacecraft. The target for the mission has not yet been selected, and there are very few potential targets currently known. Though sufficiently small near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are thought to be numerous, they are also difficult to detect and characterize with current observational facilities. Here we collect the most up-to-date information on near-Earth asteroids in this size range to outline the state of understanding of the properties of these small NEAs. Observational biases certainly mean that our sample is not an ideal representation of the true population of small NEAs. However our sample is representative of the eventual target list for the ARM mission, which will be compiled under very similar observational constraints unless dramatic changes are made to the way near-Earth asteroids are searched for and studied. <P />We collect here information on 88 near-Earth asteroids with diameters less than 60 m and with high quality light curves. We find that the typical rotation period is 40 min. Relatively few axis ratios are available for such small asteroids, so we also considered the 92 smallest NEAs with known axis ratios. This sample includes asteroids with diameters up to 300 m. The mean and median axis ratios were 1.43 and 1.29, respectively. <P />Rotation rates much faster than the spin barrier are seen, reaching below 30 s, and implying that most of these bodies are monoliths. Non-principal axis rotation is uncommon. Axial ratios often reach values as high as two, though no undisputed results reach above three. We find little correlation of axis ratio with size.

The objects in our sample range from 0.25 to 3 km in average diameter and have rotation periods from as short as 2.7 hours to as long as weeks; several are probably non-principal axis rotators.

{"abstract": "Fast development of CubeSat technology now enables the first interplanetary missions. The potential application of CubeSats to flyby near-Earth asteroids is explored in this paper in consideration of CubeSats' limited propulsive capabilities and systems constraints. Low-energy asteroid flyby trajectories are designed assuming a CubeSat is initially parked around to the Sun-Earth Lagrange points. High-impulse and low-thrust trajectories with realistic thrusting models are computed first in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP), and then in a high-fidelity ephemeris model. Analysis in the ephemeris model is used to confirm that trajectories computed in the CR3BP model also exist in a more realistic dynamical model, and to verify the validity of the results obtained in CR3BP analysis. A catalogue of asteroid flyby opportunities between years 2019 and 2030 is provided, with 80 m/s of available \u0394V and departure from halo orbits around the first and second Sun-Earth Lagrange points (of similar size to those typically used by scientific missions). Results show that the CR3BP model can serve as an effective tool to identify reachable asteroids and can provide an initial estimation of the \u0394V cost in the ephemeris model (with \u00b115 m/s accuracy). An impulsive maneuver model can also provide an accurate estimation of the \u0394V requirement for a CubeSat equipped with a high-impulse thruster (with 4 m/s accuracy), even if its thrust magnitude is small and requires duty cycling; low-thrust \u0394V requirements, however, may differ significantly from the impulsive results (\u00b115 m/s).", "title": ["High-fidelity trajectory design to flyby near-Earth asteroids using CubeSats"], "year": "2020"}

{"abstract": "2014 HQ124 was discovered by the NEOWISE mission on 2014 April 23, about six weeks before the asteroid approached within 0.0084 au on June 8. Prior to the encounter, A. K. Mainzer used NEOWISE data and a thermal model to estimate a diameter of 330 +- 90 m. The NEOWISE data and photometry obtained by J. T. Pollock yielded a rotation period of ~20 h and a lightcurve amplitude of 0.8 mag. The close approach, diameter, and slow rotation indicated that this object would provide an outstanding opportunity for radar imaging, characterization, and orbit refinement. We observed 2014 HQ124 on June 8 and 10 with at Goldstone, Arecibo, and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We conducted monostatic radar imaging at X-band (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) with the 70 m DSS-14 antenna and at S-band (2380 MHz, 13 cm) with Arecibo; bistatic X-band imaging using DSS-14 to transmit and Arecibo and the 34 m DSS-13 antenna to receive; and S-band radar speckle observations to constrain the spin state using Arecibo to transmit and the Pie Town, Los Alamos, Ft. Davis, and Kitt Peak VLBA facilities to receive. Radar astrometry improved the orbit significantly and increased the interval of reliable orbit estimation by a factor of two to ~900 years. The images achieve a resolution of 3.75 m x 0.00625 Hz and provide some of the most detailed radar views obtained for any near-Earth object. 2014 HQ124 is elongated, angular, and bifurcated with a long axis of at least 400 m. The asteroid has a large concavity, possible ridges, and small-scale features including radar-bright spots that are candidates for boulders. The larger lobe has a narrow, sinuous, ~100-m-long radar-dark feature that may be a scarp or perhaps a fault. These observations were the first test of new data taking equipment at Arecibo that can acquire images at 3.75 m resolution, which is twice as fine as the highest range resolution that Arecibo can achieve with monostatic observations. Receiving echoes at Arecibo using transmissions from Goldstone also boosts the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of five relative to monostatic Goldstone observations and is ideal for resolving very close and/or small near-Earth objects with slow spin states.", "title": ["Goldstone and Arecibo Radar Images of Near-Earth Asteroid 2014 HQ124"], "year": "2014"}
{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroid 4179 Toutatis is close to a 4:1 orbital resonance with Earth. It has been observed extensively with radar during close Earth flybys in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012. Previous radar observations have shown that Toutatis is bifurcated, ~4.5 km long, with an unusual non-principal-axis spin state. In December of 2012, Toutatis approached within 0.0463 AU (6.93 million km) of Earth, the last flyby within 0.2 AU until 2069. We conducted an extensive campaign of radar imaging and radar speckle tracking with Goldstone and with elements of the Very Large Array. The radar images were obtained on 16 days between December 4 and December 22 and include time on December 13 when the Chang\u2019e 2 spacecraft flew by the asteroid. The radar images on December 12 and 13 had range resolution of 3.75 m/pixel and show a wealth of surface features, many previously unseen, including radar-bright spots that we interpret as decameter-scale boulders similar to those visible in the Chang\u2019e 2 images. Both the 2012 radar images and the spacecraft images confirm the radar-based Toutatis shape model published by Hudson et al. 2003 (Icarus 161, 346-355) but also show where that model can be improved - particularly the big end of Toutatis, which was not imaged extensively by radar prior to 2012. During each orbit, Toutatis\u2019 spin state changes by up to 0.1% of the asteroid\u2019s total angular momentum due to gravitational tides from the Sun and Earth. We have constructed a model of Toutatis\u2019 spin state in which we numerically integrate the tidal torques on the asteroid to match the orientation of Toutatis at each apparition. The tidal spin state changes and the non-principal-axis rotation allow us to estimate Toutatis\u2019 moments of inertia independently of its shape. We will present the 2012 radar images and describe our current knowledge of the asteroid\u2019s shape and spin state.

{"abstract": "Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) are excellent laboratories for processes that affect the surfaces of airless bodies. Most NEAs are not expected to contain surface volatiles such as OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O since they formed in the anhydrous regions of the solar system and since their surface temperatures are high enough to evaporate such volatiles. However, OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O has been discovered on other seemingly dry bodies in the inner solar system, such as the Moon and Vesta. Possible sources for OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O on these bodies include carbonaceous chondrite impacts and interactions with protons implanted by solar wind. NEAs should be subjected to the same processes as other \u201cdry\u201d bodies in the inner solar system so are hypothesized to also contain OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O on their surfaces. We observed NEAs using SpeX on NASA\u2019s Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Spectra were collected using both prism (0.7-2.52 \u00b5m) and LXD_short (1.67-4.2 \u00b5m) modes in order to accurately characterize asteroid type and the 3-\u00b5m region, where the OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O signature is present. We have made 19 observations of 13 NEAs as part of this ongoing project, with five more observations scheduled for this Fall. Of those, at least 3 NEAs exhibit an absorption feature in the 3-\u00b5m region: (433) Eros, (1036) Ganymed, and (3122) Florence. Eros and Ganymed have both been observed multiple times and by multiple observers (e.g., Rivkin et al. 2017), including two observations of Eros in Fall 2016, and Florence will be observed again in early September. Of the other 10 NEAs studied, eight do not exhibit a 3-\u00b5m spectral feature. The spectra for 1998 XB and 2014 JO25 are too noisy to definitively determine the presence of volatiles. Characterizing the shape of the 3-\u00b5m absorption feature can yield information on the source of the OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O on the surface. Shallow features that gradually slope upward towards the continuum, such as is present in the spectra of Eros and Ganymed, indicate the presence of OH, which is inferred to have formed due to solar wind proton bombardment.

{"abstract": "This is a progress report on a project to characterize the surface composition (and other properties such as radius, albedo and thermal inertia) of a sample of low perihelion Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), using spec-troscopy in the 0.3 to 2.5 micron region (groundbased) and in the 7 to 14 micron region (Spitzer). NEAs with low perihelion distances represent a unique laboratory in which to study the effects of thermal processing on asteroid surfaces. We will study the mineral and or-ganic composition of our targets and we will search for correlations between their spectral characteristics and other properties such as size, albedo, rotational and orbital properties. Understanding how asteroid surfaces change as a result of exposure to high temperatures will help constrain models of the compositional and thermal environment in the region of the protoplanetary disk where asteroids formed. Part of the motivation to study these low perihelion NEAs comes from the results of our recent study of 3200 Phaethon [1], where we found indications that the surface mineralogy of this low perihelion NEA may have been altered by the perihe-lion thermal pulse. More specifically, the only two me-teorite samples that showed approximately the same spectral shape (in the visible and near-infrared) as Phaethon, had been heated.

{"abstract": "Studies of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are important to our understanding of meteorites, impact probabilities for terrestrial planets, dynamics of the main belt, and asteroid surface processes. Crucial to these investigations is knowledge of the NEA size and albedo distributions and regolith properties; however, as we sample ever-smaller NEAs, we see an increasing variation in these physical properties. A notable diversity of shapes, surface features, and rotation states have been revealed by radar observations, whereas infrared observations have shown a range of spectral types and thermal characteristics. Although spacecraft missions will yield details for a few objects, and space-based surveys will result in important overviews, only ground-based observations can provide an overall understanding of the NEA population as a whole owing to the range of observing conditions (e.g., wavelength coverage, phase angle, heliocentric distance) they provide. <P />Radiometry is commonly used to infer both size and thermal properties, but necessary assumptions about the regolith, which controls thermal and (often) radar reflectance properties, can be especially dangerous for small NEAs because surface properties change as a function of size and irregular shapes play an increasingly important role. Our investigation combines thermal measurements with radar delay-Doppler imaging to better understand the regolith properties of different types of NEAs through detailed thermophysical modeling. <P />Over the past five years, we have measured the spectra of 53 NEAs at different phase angles and rotation phases to see how the inferred thermal properties depend on the detailed shape. The observations were carried out with SpeX at the NASA IRTF (0.8--4 microns) [1], which allows us to measure both the reflected and thermal contributions to the overall spectrum, thereby providing for a greater degree of self- consistency in the thermal modeling than infrared observations alone. The observed objects span a variety of spectral types: S-complex, C-complex, and X-complex, including two high-albedo (Tholen E-type) and two low-albedo (Tholen P-type) asteroids. Most of these objects were also observed with the Arecibo planetary radar. Although the quality of the radar data varies, for many of the objects we can determine the pole, spin state, and surface features from shape modeling without assuming a convex surface [e.g., 2,3]. These radar objects span a gamut of types, from nearly spherical to elongated or irregular shapes, single bodies to contact binaries to multiple-body systems, slow to fast rotators, and sizes from a few hundred meters to a few kilometers. <P />To study the properties of these NEAs, we have developed a thermophysical model, ''SHERMAN'', that uses the detailed shape to simulate multiple observations of an NEA at different viewing geometries, which we then compare to the actual infrared observations to infer the regolith properties. SHERMAN computes the local surface temperature for each facet on the asteroid at the time of observation, including self-shadowing, multiple scattering, and sub-scale roughness [modeled as small hemispherical craters following the methods of 4,5]. We will present an overview of our dataset as well as specific examples comparing our thermal modeling results to those from simple models such as NEATM [6] to illustrate some of the effects shape, observing geometry, and asteroid composition can have on the derived properties.", "title": ["Understanding near-Earth asteroids: Is it in the details?"], "year": "2014"}
{"abstract": "The connection between orbital and temperature history of small Solar System bodies has only been studied through modeling. The upcoming OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission provides an opportunity to connect thermal modeling predictions with laboratory studies of meteorites to predict past heating and thus dynamical histories of bodies such as OSIRIS-REx mission target asteroid (101955) Bennu. Bennu is a desirable target for asteroid sample return due to its inferred primitive nature, likely 4.5 Gyr old, with chemistry and mineralogy established in the first 10 Myr of solar system history (Lauretta et al. 2015). Delbo &amp; Michel (2011) studied connections between the temperature and orbital history of Bennu. Their results suggest that the surface of Bennu (assuming no regolith turnover) has a 50% probability of being heated to 500 K in the past. Further, the Delbo &amp; Michel simulations show that the temperature within the asteroid below the top layer of regolith could remain at temperatures ~100 K below that of the surface. The Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism on OSIRIS-REx could access both the surface and near surface regolith, collecting primitive asteroid material for study in Earth-based laboratories in 2023. To quantify the effects of thermal metamorphism on the Bennu regolith, laboratory heating experiments on carbonaceous chondrite meteorites with compositions likely similar to that of Bennu were conducted from 300-1200 K. These experiments show mobilization and volatilization of a suite of labile elements (sulfur, mercury, arsenic, tellurium, selenium, antimony, and cadmium) at temperatures that could be reached by asteroids that cross Mercury's orbit. We are able to quantify element loss with temperature for several carbonaceous chondrites and use these results to constrain past orbital histories of Bennu. When OSIRIS-REx samples arrive for analysis we will be able to measure labile element loss in the material, determine maximum past temperature of the samples, and predict the past orbital and thermal history of Bennu.", "title": ["Thermal History of Near-Earth Asteroids: Implications for OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return"], "year": "2016"}
{"abstract": "Since the Sun-Earth libration points L<SUB>1</SUB> and L<SUB>2</SUB> are regarded as ideal locations for space science missions and candidate gateways for future crewed interplanetary missions, capturing near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) around the Sun-Earth L<SUB>1</SUB>/L<SUB>2</SUB> points has generated significant interest. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of coupling together a flyby of the Earth and then capturing small NEAs onto Sun-Earth L<SUB>1</SUB>/L<SUB>2</SUB> periodic orbits. In this capture strategy, the Sun-Earth circular restricted three-body problem (CRTBP) is used to calculate target Lypaunov orbits and their invariant manifolds. A periapsis map is then employed to determine the required perigee of the Earth flyby. Moreover, depending on the perigee distance of the flyby, Earth flybys with and without aerobraking are investigated to design a transfer trajectory capturing a small NEA from its initial orbit to the stable manifolds associated with Sun-Earth L<SUB>1</SUB>/L<SUB>2</SUB> periodic orbits. Finally, a global optimization is carried out, based on a detailed design procedure for NEA capture using an Earth flyby. Results show that the NEA capture strategies using an Earth flyby with and without aerobraking both have the potential to be of lower cost in terms of energy requirements than a direct NEA capture strategy without the Earth flyby. Moreover, NEA capture with an Earth flyby also has the potential for a shorter flight time compared to the NEA capture strategy without the Earth flyby.", "title": ["Low-energy near Earth asteroid capture using Earth flybys and aerobraking"], "year": "2018"}
{"abstract": "Binary asteroid 1862 Apollo has an extensive observational history allowing many of its characteristics to be investigated. Apollo was one of the first objects to show evidence for the YORP effect (Kaasalainen et al. 2007, Nature 446, 420) and its mass has been estimated by detection of the Yarkovsky effect (Nugent et al. 2012, AJ 144, 60; Farnocchia et al. 2013, Icarus 224, 1). We observed Apollo at Arecibo and Goldstone from Oct. 29-Nov. 13, 2005, obtaining a series of echo power spectra and delay-Doppler images that achieved resolutions as high as 7.5 m/pixel. The Arecibo images show that Apollo is a binary system with a rounded primary that has two large protrusions about 120 deg apart in longitude. We used the Arecibo data and published lightcurves to estimate the primary's 3D shape. Our best fit has major axes of ~1.8x1.5x1.3 km and a volume of ~1.6 km^3. The protrusions have lengths of ~300 and 200 m, are on the primary's equator, and give Apollo a distinctly different appearance from the primaries with equatorial ridges seen with other binary near-Earth asteroids. We estimated the pole by starting with the Kaasalainen et al. spin vector of ecliptic (longitude, latitude)=(50 deg, -71 deg) +- 7 deg and letting it float. Our best fit has a pole within 11 deg of (longitude, latitude)=(71, -72). Convex models produced from inversion of lightcurves by Kaasalainen et al. and thermal infrared data by Rozitis et al. (2013, A&amp;A 555, A20) are more oblate than our model, do not show protrusions, and have somewhat different pole directions. The Arecibo images reveal weak but persistent echoes from a satellite on Nov. 1 and 2 but cover only a fraction of its orbit. The images are insufficient to estimate the satellite's shape and yield a rough estimate for its long axis of 190 m. Preliminary fits give an orbital period of ~27.0-27.5 h and a semimajor axis of ~3.5-4.0 km, implying a mass of 2.8-3.9E12 kg and a bulk density of 1.7-2.4 g/cm^3. The density is consistent with estimates reported by Rozitis et al. and Farnocchia et al., providing the first independent test using a binary to estimate the density of near-Earth asteroid that has also been estimated through detection of the Yarkovsky effect.", "title": ["Radar observations and physical modeling of binary near-Earth asteroid (1862) Apollo"], "year": "2014"}
{"abstract": "The searching completion of Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) is the premise of planetary defense. In order to quantify the observation efficiency of NEAs, a method for evaluating the observation efficiency is proposed, which includes telescope parameters and station conditions. Considering the signal-to-noise ratio of target and the NEAs visibility model, detect condition and evaluation index are defined to evaluate the observation efficiency. Then, based on the NEAs orbit data and the size distribution model, the simulated NEAs orbit database is established. Finally, two observation stations, Xuyi and Lenghu, are chosen for simulation analysis. The results show that without considering the effective observation time, the observation efficiency of CNEOST (China Near-Earth Object Survey Telescope) in Lenghu increased by 5.21 times than in Xuyi within one month.

{"abstract": "There are currently over 20,000 known near earth asteroids(NEAs) and more are being discovered on a daily basis. Near earth asteroids are the small bodies whose orbits bring them to proximity with Earth, which makes them a unique opportunity for science and commercial missions. In this study, we search for mission opportunities and design and evaluate asteroid mining missions for all known NEAs. With the help of high-performance computing system, a trajectory database that contains all possible round-trip missions to all accessible NEAs between 2030-2065 was created. Details of 2 billion trips, including departure date, stay time, flight time and delta-Vs in different mission stages are recorded. Statistical results of these mission opportunities are given in this study. Meanwhile, NEAs' taxonomy results from various asteroid classification systems are summarised, and the available resources are analysed based on the taxonomy results. General space mining architectures are proposed in the study. Based on the trajectory database and mining architectures, several figures of merit, such as retrievable mass and propellant consumption, were calculated to evaluate the feasibility of mining missions/targets. A retrievable mass map for NEAs is generated based on the figures of merit calculation. Feasible targets for water mining, PGMs mining and other resource mining (e.g. silicates) between 2030-2065 are given based on current known taxonomy information. Furthermore, as the vast majority of NEAs are yet to be classified, the remaining unclassified asteroids are assumed to be water bearing and PGMs bearing asteroids respectively, and feasible targets for future mining missions are given.", "title": ["Search and evaluation of near-earth asteroid long stay-time mining missions"], "year": "2021"}

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroid 2100 Ra-Shalom has been the subject of extensive study for numerous years, but its physical nature is still poorly understood. We are using the shape-based thermophysical model SHERMAN to investigate the thermal properties of Ra-Shalom's surface. The model is constrained by spectra obtained in August 2019-September 2019 at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). We find that a single, consistent set of thermal parameters fits four of the five nights of observations; however, on the fifth night those thermal parameters do not fit with the observations. Because the asteroid was at a different viewing orientation on that night, it is possible that Ra-Shalom has a different composition or a surface feature in the observed hemisphere. A previous study conducted by [1] utilized a radar-derived shape model assuming a prograde rotation, but they were unable to incorporate any lightcurves. For our thermophysical modeling, we assumed the retrograde rotation and shape model derived by [1] from extensive lightcurve observations, but we are using radar data taken in 2000 and 2003 from Arecibo to enhance the lightcurve shape model. The radar images indicate surface features and concavities on the shape model which may affect the thermal model calculations. We will present a comparison of the lightcurve shape model and our newly derived lightcurve+radar shape model. We will also compare the thermophysical properties inferred using the new shape model to determine if a single set of homogeneous thermal properties can fit the observed spectra of Ra-Shalom.

Equal-mass binaries make up less than 1% of radar-observed near-Earth objects larger than 200 meters in diameter compared to roughly 15% for bilobate (peanut-shaped) asteroids and roughly 15% for binaries with more disparate sizes. Both components in the 2017 YE5 system are approximately 900 m in diameter, implying a very dark optical albedo of less than 3% for an absolute magnitude of 19.2. When combined with their relatively close approach to Earth, within about 16 lunar distances (6 million km), the radar images of 2017 YE5, with resolution as fine as 7.5 m per pixel, are the best yet of an equal-mass binary system. The radar images suggest the components have somewhat different shapes and possibly different radar-scattering properties. Variation in the radar images from day to day suggests the system was initially viewed far from edge on and that the mutual orbit has a separation of about four component radii and a period of roughly one day.

{"abstract": "The study of the near-Earth object 2201 Oljato has resulted in many surprises in the decade in which it has been examined. Its orbital properties have been associated with meteor showers, and its modeled orbital evolution is chaotic, a property which might indicate a history related to comets. Telescopic observations of its visible and near-infrared spectral reflectance, broad-band visible and near-infrared photometry, infrared radiometric measurements, and radar echoes are reported here from two apparitions, 1979 and 1983. A look at all available observational data shows that this asteroid has a high radiometric albedo, a property not associated with comet nuclei. In certain wavelength regimes it is classified as an S-type asteroid, in others, an E-type, but its overall spectral reflectance is not typical of either taxonomic type, and neither type is thought of as cometlike. Unexpectedly high ultraviolet reflectance at the 1979 apparition was suggested to be the result of residual outgassing as in a comet. The UV photometric data are modeled as fluorescent emission from neutral species found in comets. The resulting calculations indicate a plausible value for OH and CN emission at 0.3085 and 0.38 \u03bcm relative to the observed range of active comets.

Reflectance spectra of excavated material exhibit a hydroxyl (OH) absorption feature that is slightly stronger and peak-shifted compared with that observed for the surface, indicating that space weathering and/or radiative heating have caused subtle spectral changes in the uppermost surface. The strength and shape of the OH feature suggests that the subsurface material experienced heating above 300 \u00b0C, similar to the surface. In contrast, thermophysical modelling indicates that radiative heating cannot increase the temperature above 200 \u00b0C at the estimated excavation depth of 1 m, even at the smallest heliocentric distance possible for Ryugu.

Each spacecraft has its own kick stage for this injection maneuver. This paper briefly describes the spacecraft design and capability, the asteroid flyby opportunities available within the coming decade, and other possible mission scenarios which could take advantage of a single launch multi-spacecraft option.", "title": ["A multi-mission flyby strategy for the near-earth asteroids"], "year": "1992"}

{"abstract": "Without knowing the size and composition of Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) it is hard to assess their threat or their promise as either Earth-impactors or targets for exploration, retrieval or resources. <P />The factor of about 10 uncertainty in albedo that exists with only an optical H magnitude in hand leads to a factor 30 uncertainty in volume and more in mass. A simple classification into carbonaceous, stony or metallic limits the albedo range to a factor about 2, the volume to a factor of about 2.5 and mass to about 5 (Mainzer et al. 2011, Thomas et al. 2011). <P />NEAs are being discovered at a rate of about 1000/year, and this rate will soon increase by a factor of several with upgrades to the Catalina Sky Survey and the greater use of Pan-STARRS-1 for NEA work from 2014 onwards. However, NEA characterization is falling well behind discovery, forming a bottleneck for programs. The largest program of 0.8-2.5 micron near-IR spectroscopy, the MIT-IRTF program, obtains about 100 NEA spectra/year, for an accumulated total of about 1000 spectra (mostly at H &lt; 15, R.P. Binzel, priv.comm.). At current rates it will take 100 years to obtain compositions, sizes, and shapes of the roughly 20,000 H&lt;22 NEAs. Moreover, NEAs fade quickly after discovery and are mostly much fainter on a subsequent apparition, so that rapid follow-up at discovery is essential (Beeson et al. 2014, see also Galache et al., this meeting). <P />LINNAEUS is the program we have proposed in response to this need. Optical spectroscopy is sufficient to accomplish C/S/X classification and is much more sensitive than near-infrared spectroscopy. LINNAEUS combines 50% of the observing time on the Kitt Peak 2.1 meter telescope with an optimized low-resolution 0.4-0.9 micron optical spectrograph, the SED Machine (Ben-Mazi et al. 2013), to obtain 1200-2000 NEO spectra per year for a total of 4200 - 7000 spectra in 3.5 years of observing. LINNAEUS would provide an order of magnitude increase over current rates, keeping characterization up to the pace of expected discoveries. For a 20% extra investment LINNAEUS could use 100% of the Kitt Peak 2.1 meter, roughly doubling the number of NEAs with spectra.", "title": ["LINNAEUS: Boosting near-Earth asteroid characterization rates"], "year": "2014"}

Weighted, optimally filtered sums of cw and delay-Doppler echoes achieve signal-to-noise ratios of ~ 80 and ~ 30, respectively, and cover about 180deg of rotation phase (period = 14.90 hr; P. Pravec, pers. comm.). Our cw observations place up to four 2-Hz-resolution cells on Bacchus at echo powers greater than two standard deviations of the noise. Delay-Doppler observations typically place about ten 75 m x 1 Hz cells on Bacchus above the same threshold. A weighted sum of all cw spectra gives an OC radar cross section of 0.12+/-0.06 km(2) and a circular polarization ratio of 0.21+/-0.01. The dispersion of the echoes in time delay indicates a lower bound on Bacchus' maximum pole-on breadth of 0.7 km that is consistent with the echo bandwidth of 6+/-2 Hz and Pravec's rotation period. Echo cw spectra on March 22 and delay-Doppler images on all three days show a central deficit of echo power that indicates a bifurcation in the shape. If we assume the projected area of Bacchus is the same as that of a 0.7-km-diameter sphere, then its radar cross section and absolute magnitude of 16.9 correspond to upper limits on the radar and optical albedos that do not exclude Bacchus from any taxonomic class. The circular polarization ratio is indicative of a near-surface that is less rough at centimenter-to-decimeter spatial scales than the average radar-detected near-Earth asteroid.", "title": ["Radar Observations of Near-Earth Asteroid 2063 Bacchus"], "year": "1997"}

The object's 2010 closest approach to the Earth was quite distant (delta=0.24 AU on June 29 2010). However, the 2010 apparition allows the NEO to be observed under slowly varying illumination and viewing geometry.

{"abstract": "The possible end result of the utilization of raw materials garnered from near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) has been well documented if often a bit fanciful. Very few have put forward an end-to-end plan from prospecting to mine closure for any specific asteroid or for any particular asteroid resource. There are many aspects to planning for the mining of raw materials from asteroids that have never been encountered in terrestrial resource exploitation due to the dispersed nature of the asteroids. As an example from petroleum exploration, if a dry hole is drilled in a large geologic setting indicative of petroleum deposits, one only need pack the drill rig up and move it to a new spot. In asteroid exploitation, the problem of \"moving to a new spot\" is complicated, as the \"new spot\" is moving constantly and may be many millions of kilometers distant at great cost in time and rocket fuel. This paper will outline a relatively low-risk, probable high-return, end-to-end plan for the exploitation and utilization of asteroid raw materials. All aspects of exploration and mining will attempt to be addressed, from prospecting, exploration, and evaluation of possible resources to initialization, industrialization, and closure of the mine.

{"abstract": "Traditional planetary radar polarimetry is limited to analyzing the circularly polarized component of the received signal, which when combined with knowledge of the known circularly polarized transmitted signal, gives information about the scattering properties of the target surface. This type of analysis neglects the randomly polarized (depolarized) and linearly polarized components of the received signal, which provide information on the surface morphological complexity and subsurface scattering. Measuring the full polarization state, or equivalently the Stokes vector, of radar echoes from the Moon (Stacy, 1993 PhD, Cornell) and Venus (Carter et al., 2004 JGR 109; 2006 JGR 111) has revealed geomorphology such as buried lava flows, pyroclastic deposits, and fine-grained crater ejecta.

The discrepancy between the physical interpretation of radar polarimetry of (1019555) Bennu (hereafter Bennu) and the surface as revealed by OSIRIS-REx further necessitates a re-evaluation of our understanding of radar scattering on NEAs. <P />We will present recent work in decomposing the full polarization state of archival radar observations of NEAs from Arecibo Observatory (AO).

We augment the interpretation of the m-chi decomposition, originally applied to the lunar surface, for NEA surfaces through numerical simulations of m-chi decompositions of morphologically complex particles, similar to those observed on the surfaces of Bennu and (162713) Ryugu.

{"abstract": "We report the detection of a small Near Earth Asteroid, at an apparant magnitudeof 23.0, moving 5.8 deg/day, with the Chimera camera on the Palomar 5m telescope. If this object had been observed with a normal 30sec CCD exposure, the streak would be 7.25 arcsec long and the surface brightness of the streak would be equal to a 25.2mag star. The synthetic tracking data was taken with an EMCCD camera at 15 frames/sec, while the telescoe was moving slightly slower than sidereal rate, so the field of view would drift 2.5arcmin in 30 sec. The camera had a 2.5arcmin field of view. This drift scan would continue for ~1hr surveying a 5 deg*2.5arcmin patch of the sky for Near Earth Asteroids. 1 hr later the same patch of the sky was scanned again to provide a confiming observation. Over 2 night we surveyed a 1.25 sqdeg area of the sky. The data was analyzed using a shift/add algorithm where each successive image in the 450 frame data set was shifted to match the velocity of the Asteroid. Since we did not know the velocity of the asteroid, shift/add was performed with 2500 different velocities in a NVidia GPU.. The NEA was detected twice ~1hr apart with a SN 15 each time, the NEA had moved ~1000 arcsec during that hour. The synthetic tracking algorithm produces position, velocity and brightness for each 30sec observation. The position of the NEA in the 2nd observation was consistent with the position and velocity of the 1st observation. We could not solve for an orbit with just two observations, but if the transverse velocity of the NEA was 10km/s, then this object would have been an H=29 mag NEA detected at a distance of 20 lunar distances, ~8m in diameter. This expected number of NEA detections for these two nights of observing was 1.5 objects fainter than H&gt;28mag. A future upgraded version of this camera with a 25arcmin field of view could potentially detect ~150 small H&gt;28mag NEA's per night.

{"abstract": "We present here VRI spectrophotometry of 39 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) observed with the Sutherland, South Africa, node of the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet). Of the 39 NEAs, 19 were targeted, but because of KMTNet\u2019s large 2 deg \u00d7 2 deg field of view, 20 serendipitous NEAs were also captured in the observing fields. Our rapid-response approach meant targeted observations were performed within 44 days (median: 16 days, min: 4 days) of each NEA\u2019s discovery date. Our broadband spectrophotometry is reliable enough to distinguish among four asteroid taxonomies and we were able to confidently categorize 31 of the 39 observed targets as either a S-, C-, X- or D-type asteroid. Our data suggest that the ratio between \u201cstony\u201d S-type NEAs and \u201cnot- stony\u201d (C+X+D)-type NEAs, with H magnitudes between 15 and 25, is roughly 1:1. Additionally, we report ~1-hour light curve data for each NEA. Of the 39 targets, we were able to resolve the complete rotation period and amplitude for six and place lower limits for the remaining targets.Based on the success of this pilot study we plan to continue KMTNet observations but also make use of Lesedi, a new 1-meter remotely-operable telescope also situated in Sutherland, to perform similar spectrophotometric observations in the future. As before, we plan to target newly discovered NEAs in order to continue the rapid-response approach. With Lesedi, observations will take place throughout the year and we plan to include smaller NEAs (larger H magnitudes) in our sample.

{"abstract": "Driven by curiosity about possible flight options for the Chang'e-2 spacecraft after it remains at the Sun-Earth L2 point, effective approaches were developed for designing preliminary fuel-optimal near-Earth asteroid flyby trajectories. The approaches include the use of modified unstable manifolds, grid search of the manifolds' parameters, and a two-impulse maneuver for orbital phase matching and z-axis bias change, and are demonstrated to be effective in asteroid target screening and trajectory optimization. Asteroid flybys are expected to be within a distance of 2 \u00d7 10<SUP>7</SUP> km from the Earth owing to the constrained Earth-spacecraft communication range. In this case, the spacecraft's orbital motion is significantly affected by the gravities of both the Sun and the Earth, and therefore, the concept of the \"heliocentric oscillating-Kepler orbit\" is proposed, because the classical orbital elements of the flyby trajectories referenced in the heliocentric inertial frame oscillate significantly with respect to time.

{"abstract": "We present Goldstone radar imaging of four near-Earth asteroids during Feb-Jun 2017. The signal-to-noise ratios were very strong for each object and we obtained detailed images with range resolutions as fine as 3.75 m/pixel. 2017 BQ6 was discovered on Jan 26 and approached Earth within 6.5 lunar distances on Feb 7. Radar images show that it is a strikingly angular object roughly 200 m in diameter with a rotation period of 3 h. Its multi-faceted shape challenges the expectation that it is a rubble pile. 2017 CS was discovered on Feb 2 and approached within 8 lunar distances on May 29. It appears rounded on large scales but has considerable fine-scale topography evident along its leading edges. The images suggest a diameter of 1 km and a spin period consistent with the 40 h period obtained from photometry by P. Pravec (pers. comm.). The highest resolution images show evidence for meter-size boulders, ridges, and broad concavities. 2007 WV4 was imaged in late May and early June, has a diameter of 900 meters, and appears distinctly angular with at least three large facets &gt; 100 m in extent. Tracking of features in the images gives a rotation period of about 12 hours. 2014 JO25 approached within 4.6 lunar distances on April 19. This was the closest encounter by an asteroid with an absolute magnitude brighter than 18 known in advance until 2027, when 1999 AN10 will approach within one lunar distance. Radar imaging shows that 2014 JO25 is an irregular object, consisting of two components connected by a narrow neck. The asteroid has pole on dimensions of roughly 1 x 0.6 km in the images. Imaging with 3.75 m/pixel resolution places thousands of pixels on the object and reveals ridges, concavities, flat regions up to 200 meters long, and radar-bright spots suggestive of boulders. Tracking of features in the images yields a rotation period of about 4.5 hours that is among the fastest of the 50 known contact binaries in the near-Earth population.", "title": ["Goldstone radar imaging of near-Earth asteroids (469896) 2007 WV4, 2014 JO25, 2017 BQ6, and 2017 CS"], "year": "2017"}
{"abstract": "Binary systems comprise \u223c1/6 of the near-Earth object population larger than 200 meters in diameter, providing important clues to asteroids' masses and densities. On May 31, 2013, the binary near-Earth-asteroid system (285263) 1998 QE_2 had a 0.04-au close approach to the Earth. We observed the binary system from May 30 to June 27 with the Goldstone Solar System Radar (which discovered the system's binary nature, operating at 3.5 cm / 8.56 GHz) and Arecibo Observatory planetary radar system (operating at 12.6 cm / 2.38 GHz). The size of the QE_2 primary and the short light travel time afforded us an excellent data set of high resolution delay-Doppler images as fine as 7.5 meters/pixel of this asteroid and its moon. We used the extensive radar dataset to fit 3D shape models for both primary and secondary using a nonlinear iterative inverse process [1,2]. A preliminary scale model for both system components is shown in the figure. The preliminary primary model is a roughly spherical body, 3.2 \u00b1 0.3 km in effective diameter. Some radar-bright spots in the delay-Doppler images may be indicative of boulders. Lightcurve data show a rotation period of 4.749 \u00b1 0.002 h for the primary [3]. The best fit to a subset of radar data suggests a prograde pole at (119\u00b0, +35\u00b0) in ecliptic coordinates [4]. The secondary model indicates an effective diameter of 800 \u00b1 80 m (for a primary:secondary diameter ratio of \u22484:1) for an elongated object with a concavity on one side of the long axis. The secondary is in a tidally locked spin state with an orbital period of 31.31 \u00b1 0.01 h hours derived from radar, and a semimajor orbital axis of 6.2 \u00b1 0.1 km (approximately quadruple the radius of the primary). The orbit is approximately circular (e &lt; 0.01), which is typical of most near-Earth-asteroid binary-system orbits. We assume that the primary and secondary poles are aligned with the best-fit mutual-orbit pole. All orbital parameters were derived from radar data. From orbital fits, we estimate the system mass to be 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 10^{13} kg, giving a preliminary density for the primary of 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 g/cm^{3}. The low density implies a high porosity for the primary consistent with a gravitational aggregate or ''rubble-pile'' structure. We will continue to refine the shape models for both the primary and the secondary to further investigate both the physical properties and dynamics of the 1998 QE_2 system.", "title": ["Shape model of the binary near-Earth asteroid (285263) 1998 QE_2"], "year": "2014"}
{"abstract": "Making a survey of Itokawids, i.e., meteor(oid)s originating from Apollo-type near-Earth Asteroid (25143) Itokawa, from among the multiple-station optical meteor orbit data, and employing several orbital similarity criteria, we found five Itokawid candidates. Furthermore, we classified the Itokawid candidates in meteorite types according to their physical data. The physical analyses indicate that all of the candidates evidently belong to not cometary, but asteroidal, meteoroids. Especially, the fireball, MORP 172, is the one candidate that is classified among ordinary/carbonaceous chondrites, as against the four other at carbonaceous chondrites. Hence, the classified meteoritic matter of MORP 172 shows more similarities to Itokawa's surface composition of an LL chondrite analogue than those of the other candidates.

{"abstract": "The Goldstone (70-m diameter, 8560 MHz/X band) and Arecibo (305-m diameter, 2380 MHz/S band) solar system radars have long worked independently, yet in tandem, to observe near-Earth asteroids as they make close flybys of Earth. The complementary nature of each site's strengths, Goldstone's maneuverability (and, recently, higher spatial resolution) and Arecibo's higher nominal output power and unmatched collecting area, allow for better constraints on sizes, shapes, spin states, and surface properties of near-Earth asteroids than either system can provide on its own. Here, we will discuss a handful of objects observed with both facilities, including binary asteroids (285263) 1998 QE2 and (153958) 2002 AM31 and contact-binary asteroid (192642) 1999 RD32, and describe how the complementary nature of the Goldstone and Arecibo radars has enhanced our knowledge of these small bodies. The importance of collaboration between Goldstone and Arecibo will only increase in the future as we look to expand the use of high-resolution bistatic observations of near-Earth asteroids, where both sites simultaneously observe a target. Observations this past June during the close flyby of 2014 HQ124 (Benner et al., this meeting) demonstrated reception at Arecibo of a 40-MHz bandwidth (3.75-m resolution), X-band transmission from Goldstone.

{"abstract": "The density of near earth asteroids is a fundamental property which can illuminate the structure of the asteroid and is key in assessing the risk of an impact of an NEA with Earth. A low density can be indicative of a rubble pile structure whereas a higher density can imply a monolith and/or a higher metal content. Since the damage resulting from an impact of an asteroid with Earth depends on its interior structure and its total mass, density is a key parameter to understanding the risk of asteroid impact. Unfortunately, measuring the density of asteroids is extremely difficult, has only been attempted for a tiny fraction of NEAs and usually results in measurements with large uncertainties. In the absence of density measurements for a specific object, understanding the range and distribution of likely densities can allow for probabilistic assessment of the ensemble risk of an impact of an NEA and permit estimates of the range of reasonable masses for specific object. We have developed a candidate density distribution for near earth asteroids based on measurements of meteorite densities and an assumed range of macroporosities.

{"abstract": "We obtained thorough photometric observations of two binary near-Earth asteroids (66391) Moshup = 1999 KW4 and (88710) 2001 SL9 taken from 2000 to 2019 and derived physical and dynamical properties of the binary systems. We found that the data for 1999 KW4 are inconsistent with a constant orbital period and we obtained unique solution with a quadratic drift of the mean anomaly of the satellite of -0.65 +/- 0.16 deg/yr2 (all quoted uncertainties are 3sigma). This means that the semimajor axis of the mutual orbit of the components of this binary system increases in time with a mean rate of 1.2 +/- 0.3 cm/yr. The data for 2001 SL9 are also inconsistent with a constant orbital period and we obtained two solutions for the quadratic drift of the mean anomaly: 2.8 +/- 0.2 and 5.2 +/- 0.2 deg/yr2, implying that the semimajor axis of the mutual orbit of the components decreases in time with a mean rate of -2.8 +/- 0.2 or -5.1 +/- 0.2 cm/yr for the two solutions, respectively. The expanding orbit of 1999 KW4 may be explained by mutual tides interplaying with binary YORP (BYORP) effect (McMahon and Scheeres, 2010). However, a modeling of the BYORP drift using radar-derived shapes of the binary components predicted a much higher value of the orbital drift than the observed one. It suggests that either the radar-derived shape model of the secondary is inadequate for computing the BYORP effect, or the present theory of BYORP overestimates it. It is possible that the BYORP coefficient has instead an opposite sign than predicted; in that case, the system may be moving into an equilibrium between the BYORP and the tides. In the case of 2001 SL9, the BYORP effect is the only known physical mechanism that can cause the inward drift of its mutual orbit.", "title": ["A satellite orbit drift in binary near-Earth asteroids (66391) 1999 KW4 and (88710) 2001 SL9 -- Indication of the BYORP effect"], "year": "2019"}
{"abstract": "The Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radars are invaluable instruments for the discovery and characterization of binary and triple asteroids in the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population. To date, 41 out of 56 known binaries and triples (~73% of the objects) have been discovered by radar and 49 of these multiple systems have been detected by radar. Their absolute magnitudes range from 12.4 for (1866) Sisyphus to 22.6 for 2015 TD144 and have a mean and rms dispersion of 18.1+-2.0. There is a pronounced decrease in the abundance of binaries for absolute magnitudes H&gt;20.

Among 365 NEAs with H&lt;22 (corresponding to diameters larger than ~ 140 m) detected by radar since 1999, ~13% have at least one companion. Two triple systems are known, (15391) 2001 SN263 and (136617) 1994 CC, but this is probably an underestimate due to low signal to noise ratios (SNRs) for many of the binary radar detections.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a mission analysis comparison of human missions to asteroids using two distinct architectures. The objective is to determine if either architecture can reduce launch mass with respect to the other, while not sacrificing other performance metrics such as mission duration. One architecture relies on chemical propulsion, the traditional workhorse of space exploration. The second combines chemical and electric propulsion into a hybrid architecture that attempts to utilize the strengths of each, namely the short flight times of chemical propulsion and the propellant efficiency of electric propulsion. The architectures are thoroughly detailed, and accessibility of the known asteroid population is determined for both. The most accessible asteroids are discussed in detail. Aspects such as mission abort scenarios and vehicle reusability are also discussed. Ultimately, it is determined that launch mass can be greatly reduced with the hybrid architecture, without a notable increase in mission duration. This demonstrates that significant performance improvements can be introduced to the next step of human space exploration with realistic electric propulsion system capabilities. This leads to immediate cost savings for human exploration and simultaneously opens a path of technology development that leads to technologies enabling access to even further destinations in the future.", "title": ["Human exploration of near earth asteroids: Mission analysis for chemical and electric propulsion"], "year": "2014"}

Through a NASA funded project, called NEOWISE, we have systematically searched the WISE data for new and previously known asteroids, detecting over 158,000 objects (of which more than 30,000 were new discoveries). The NEOWISE project have resulted in a highly uniform survey of the near-Earth object (NEO) population at thermal infrared wavelengths ranging from 3 to 22 \u03bcm, allowing us to refine estimates of their numbers, sizes, and albedos. The survey detected NEOs the same way whether they were previously known or not, subject to the availability of ground-based follow-up observations, resulting in the discovery of more than 130 new NEOs. The survey's uniform sensitivity, observing cadence, and image quality have permitted extrapolation of the 429 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) detected by NEOWISE during the fully cryogenic portion of the WISE mission to the larger population. An additional 88 NEAs were observed in the post-cryogenic phase of the mission, with 12 of these being discoveries.

We show that the Spaceguard goal of detecting 90% of all 1 km NEAs has been met, and that the cumulative size distribution is best represented by a broken power law with a slope of 1.32\u00b10.14 below 1.5 km. This power-law slope produces about 13,200\u00b11900 NEAs with diameter larger than 140 m.

We applied several pattern recognition algorithms for determining the class of each object. The NEAs observed within our project and for which the spectral data is available were used as a training set. <P />We present the results of this program and the applicability of spectro-photometry in the visible region for studying the near-Earth asteroids. The various inaccuracies and the method limitations are constrained. The possibility to detect objects with a heterogeneous composition trough this technique is also discussed. <P />The observations with the MUSCAT-2 instrument are performed regularly (1-2 nights every month). The project started in 2018 and up to now we were able to obtain the spectro-photometric classification for 191 NEAs (107 were classified for the first time) with the absolute magnitudes distributed in the range of 12 -24.

{"abstract": "Knowing the shapes and spin states of near-Earth asteroids is essential to understanding their dynamical evolution because of the Yarkovsky and YORP effects. Delay-Doppler radar imaging is the most powerful ground-based technique for imaging near-Earth asteroids and can obtain spatial resolution of &lt;10 m, but frequently produces ambiguous pole direction solutions. A radar echo from an asteroid consists of a pattern of speckles caused by the interference of reflections from different parts of the surface. It is possible to determine an asteroid's pole direction by tracking the motion of the radar speckle pattern. Speckle tracking can potentially measure the poles of at least several radar targets each year, rapidly increasing the available sample of NEA pole directions. We observed the near-Earth asteroid 2008 EV5 with the Arecibo planetary radar and the Very Long Baseline Array in December 2008. By tracking the speckles moving from the Pie Town to Los Alamos VLBA stations, we have shown that EV5 rotates retrograde.

{"abstract": "The binary nature of near-Earth asteroid (190166) 2005 UP156 was shown by distinctive mutual events in its optical lightcurves from 2017 May 4-23 (Warner &amp; Harris, 2017; CBET 4394). The observed lightcurve period of 40.542 +/- 0.008 h agrees with the period determined in 2014 (Warner, 2015; Minor Planet Bulletin 42, 41-53), though no mutual events were noted at that time. An out-of-eclipse amplitude of 0.5 mag implies elongated shapes for the components. Radar observations with the Arecibo planetary radar system on 15 dates from 2017 June 2 to July 10 unambiguously revealed the roughly equal-size components of the binary system, only the third such system known among the near-Earth asteroids after (69230) Hermes (Margot et al., 2003; IAUC 8227) and 1994 CJ1 (Taylor et al., 2014; DPS 46, #409.03) out of more than 50 known near-Earth multiple-asteroid systems. Preliminary diameter estimates from radar images are no more than 1 km in the longest dimension for both components. Images at different orientations suggest elongated shapes with the long axes aligned, i.e., face-locked synchronous rotation, and an orbital period commensurate with the optical lightcurve period. The maximum observed separation between the components of 2.4 km places a lower limit on the semimajor axis of the system, though the projection effect should be minimal given the eclipsing nature of the lightcurves. Combined with the above upper limit on the diameters, the implied density of the system could be less than 1 g/cc, though the actual value will be sensitive to the true elongation of the shapes. Spectra of the system between 0.7 and 5.1 microns obtained with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on four dates between 2017 May 27 and July 19 suggest a Bus-DeMeo taxonomic type of S or Sq transitioning to a spectrum dominated by thermal emission beyond 3.5 microns with little variation over the two-month span of observations.", "title": ["Radar, Optical, and Infrared Observations of Equal-Mass Binary Near-Earth Asteroid (190166) 2005 UP156"], "year": "2017"}

However, that list and the one for modeling targets was biased towards brighter asteroids. We try to limit that bias by restricting the favorable apparitions and modeling lists to objects 15.0 V 16.0 at brightest. Low phase angle observations remain important but, increasingly so, only if placed on a standard photometric system, and better yet, if they are accompanied with observations out to phase angles of 20-30 degrees, something that is more easily achieved with near-Earth asteroids.

{"abstract": "Many asteroids in the Outer Main Belt may be ice-rich. We model temperature and sublimation-driven ice loss for asteroids originating from the Outer Main Belt as they become near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) or evolve onto orbits typical of Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs), based on ensembles of trajectories from N-body integrations and a model with asynchronous coupling. The majority of ice loss occurs long before an asteroid reaches a NEA- or JFC-like orbit. Factors that favour ice retention are evaluated quantitatively: orbital configuration, thermal inertia, dynamical age, and axis tilt. The least ice loss occurs at the polar regions of bodies with small axis tilt. The polar regions of these bodies remain so cold that ice does not retreat beyond the influence of the seasonal thermal wave (often &lt;5 m) by the time the objects have reached NEA- or JFC-like orbits. Hence, there is a pathway for ice-rich asteroids, such as members of the Themis family, to have retained water ice that could ultimately cause cometary activity or be used for in situ resource utilization (ISRU).

Delay-Doppler images with resolutions as fine as 19 m/pixel reveal an unusually angular object with pronounced facets. The longest sequence of images was obtained on July 4 when the asteroid rotated \u223c140 deg in 2.7 h. During this interval, bandwidths varied by a factor of \u223c1.5 and indicate that 2003 MS2 is an elongated object. The rotation and bandwidth variations evident in the radar images are consistent with the 7 h rotation period and the 0.7 magnitude lightcurve amplitude reported by Muinonen et al.

{"abstract": "Infrared observations of an asteroid can be used to estimate its size, albedo, thermal inertia, and other physical properties. However, these estimates are often based on thermal models that assume a spherical shape. Detailed shape information is only available for a small fraction of known asteroids, so making simplifying assumptions about the shape is often unavoidable. Nevertheless, it is important to quantify the errors that can arise from applying spherical thermal models to non-spherical asteroids.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) are a key testbed for many aspects of solar system science by nature of their proximity to Earth. Investigations into planet formation, asteroid dynamics, and planetary defense initiatives all rely on understanding key characteristics of NEAs such as their sizes, albedo distributions, and regolith properties. Simple thermal models are a commonly used method for analyzing NEA infrared data and determining these key NEA properties. However, these models have inherent limitations due to the simplifying assumptions they make about asteroid shapes and properties. Furthermore, the recent collapse of the Arecibo Telescope limits access to new, high-sensitivity radar data and thus direct NEA size measurements. Additionally, new facilities such as LSST and NEO Surveyor will come online soon, greatly increasing the amount of available NEA photometry. In combination, these issues will further increase the important role simple thermal models play in adding to our knowledge of the NEA population. <P />Therefore, we present a method for placing tighter constraints on inferred NEA properties using these simple models, so that they may be used more effectively moving forward. By observing an object across multiple viewing geometries and combining relative reflectance spectra with absolute photometry, we are able to place tighter bounds on modeled NEA albedos and thermal inertias than by using single observations alone. We apply this technique to the NEA (285263) 1998 QE2 using a simple thermal model we call our NEATM-like model and data from both the NASA IRTF SpeX instrument and the NEOWISE mission. We determine a narrow albedo and thermal inertia range and compare our results with existing measurements of 1998 QE2 to explore some implications for our NEATM-like model. We further present preliminary results of additional objects. Altogether, our work highlights the limitations of simple thermal models, yet also shows how these models may be better used to understand the NEA population as a whole.", "title": ["Comparison of NEATM-like Models with NASA IRTF and NEOWISE Observations of Near-Earth Asteroid (285263) 1998 QE2"], "year": "2022"}

Amongst the mission objectives is the measurement of the asteroid's thermophysical properties that contribute to the Yarkovsky effect, such as the thermal conductivity of the surface. This is important because the observations necessary to measure thermophysical properties from Earth are much more difficult than from a spacecraft platform. Another difficulty is that the highly elliptical orbits of most near-earth asteroids can greatly increase error.

We compute several diagnostic spectral parameters from the reflectance spectra of NEAs, MBs, and OCs, that are used to infer the mineralogical composition. The distribution of the obtained values are analysed in 2 different parameter spaces. We also apply a robust statistical method based on neuronal networks to those spectral parameters, to compare the NEAs with OCs. Space weathering effects and dynamical and physical properties of NEAs and MBs are also studied. <BR /> Results: Compositional differences between MBs and NEAs are inferred from the mineralogical analysis. The most remarkable results are: (1) the high olivine content of the NEAs; (2) the compositional similarity between NEAs and a small group of meteorites, the LL ordinary chondrites; and (3) that NEAs are not compositionally similar to OCs, implying that they are not the most likely parent bodies of those meteorites, as has been widely believed. To explain their apparently fresh surfaces (NEAs are on average less red than MBs), a combination of composition and size distribution (NEAs have diameters of some kilometres) should be invoked.

The scheme is started with the known absolute magnitudes and the known taxonomy classes of NEAs. Albedos are derived from the taxonomy classes, and eventually sizes can be determined.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are a kind of small solar system bodies that may lead to potential hazard to the safety of the Earth. Currently, most of the NEAs are discovered with ground-based telescopes while the number is still growing. In order to provide references and experience to our future near-Earth asteroid discovery and monitoring, we perform a multi-dimensionally statistical analysis on the discovery data of NEAs with public database obtained from the website of Minor Planet Center (MPC). We find the constraint of observation ability can lead to selection effect on the discoveries, which causes a yearly dependence trend and a size-dependence characteristic of the relative proportion of different orbit types of discovered NEAs. Besides, combined with the orbits obtained from numerical simulations, we recover the discovery scenarios of these objects. The position distribution of the objects under different celestial coordinate systems are obtained, and the dependence on seasons, observatory latitudes, and the diameters are analyzed. Finally, we quantify the impact of the Sun, the Moon and the galactic plane on the discoveries by analyzing the observation data and find that ground-based telescopes generally have difficulty in discovering NEAs within $90^\\circ$ from the Sun direction, and that this limitation generally has a greater impact on smaller-sized objects. The lunar position also has a significant effect on the discoveries, with the restriction on the nights before and after the full Moon resulting in 29\\% of NEAs being undiscovered, and analysis shows that objects found in the first half of the lunar calendar month are generally more difficult to be followed than those found in the second half. The galactic plane, especially the direction near the galactic center, also has an effect on the discoveries, resulting in a season-dependent ``blind spot'' for observations near the ecliptic.", "title": ["Statistical Analysis of Discoveries and Discovery Scenarios of Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2022"}

It is the first triple asteroid system discovered close enough to be imaged using radar and remains the only known triple NEA system. <P />To obtain a better understanding of 2001 SN263, models of the asteroid have been created using a program known as \"Shape\", designed by Hudson (1993). For 2001 SN263, light-curve data was used in conjunction with the delay-Doppler images to produce the models (Pravec personal communication).

By using Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC observations and our model for the thermophysical properties and the nongravitational forces acting on 2009 BD we obtain probabilistic derivations of the physical properties of this object. We find two physically possible solutions. The first solution shows 2009 BD as a 2.9 +/- 0.3 m diameter rocky body with an extremely high albedo that is covered with regolith-like material, causing it to exhibit a low thermal inertia.

Lowe, MPS 56779, 2002) fit poorly with the modern observations using standard n-body orbit determination models. A careful examination of the archived 1953 images reveals that the orbital prediction based on the 1992-2005 data is significantly offset in a direction orthogonal to the 1953 trail, indicating that timing uncertainty is not the cause of the poor fit.

Gravels on this small asteroid appear to be loosely deposited along the gravitational equipotential surfaces. The existence of smooth areas as well as boulder-rich rough areas indicate that gravels should have experienced migrations and segregations.

{"abstract": "2014 HQ124 was discovered by the NEOWISE spacecraft on 2014 April 23, about six weeks before the asteroid made a very close Earth flyby within 0.0084 au (3.2 lunar distances) on June 8. Prior to the encounter, A. K. Mainzer used NEOWISE data and a thermal model to estimate a diameter of 330 +- 90 m. The NEOWISE data and photometry obtained by J. T. Pollock yielded a rotation period of ~20 h and a large lightcurve amplitude of 0.8 mag. The close approach, diameter, and slow rotation period indicated that this object would provide an outstanding opportunity for radar imaging, physical characterization, and orbit refinement. We observed 2014 HQ124 on June 8 and 10 with radar at Goldstone, Arecibo, and elements of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We conducted monostatic radar imaging observations at X-band (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) with the 70 m DSS-14 antenna and at S-band (2380 MHz, 13 cm) with Arecibo; bistatic X-band observations using DSS-14 to transmit and Arecibo and the 34 m DSS-13 antenna to receive; and S-band radar speckle observations to constrain the spin state using Arecibo as a transmitter and the Pie Town, Los Alamos, Ft. Davis, and Kitt Peak VLBA facilities as receivers. Radar astrometry improved the orbit significantly and increased the interval of reliable orbit estimation by a factor of two to ~900 years. The images achieve a resolution of 3.75 m x 0.00625 Hz and provide some of the most detailed radar views ever obtained for any near-Earth object. 2014 HQ124 is elongated, angular, and bifurcated with a long axis of at least 400 m. The asteroid has at least one large concavity, possible ridges, and small-scale surface features such as numerous radar-bright spots that are candidates for boulders. The larger lobe has a narrow, sinuous, ~100-m-long radar-dark feature that may be a scarp or perhaps a fault. These observations were the first test of new data taking equipment at Arecibo that can acquire dual-polarization images at 3.75 m resolution, which is twice as fine as the highest range resolution that Arecibo can achieve with monostatic observations. Receiving echoes at Arecibo using transmissions from Goldstone also boosts the signal-to-noise ratio by about a factor of five relative to monostatic Goldstone observations and is ideal for resolving very close and/or small near-Earth objects with slow spin states.", "title": ["Goldstone and Arecibo Radar Imaging of Near-Earth Asteroid 2014 HQ124"], "year": "2014"}

{"abstract": "We present new results from bistatic Goldstone to Green Bank Telescope (GBT) high-resolution radar imaging of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). Previously, most radar observations used either the 305-m Arecibo radar or the 70-m DSS-14 radar at Goldstone. Following the installation of new data-taking equipment at the GBT in late 2014, the number of bistatic Goldstone/GBT observations has increased substantially. Receiving Goldstone radar echoes at the 100-m GBT improves the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) two- to three-fold relative to monostatic reception at DSS-14. The higher SNRs allow us to obtain higher resolution images than is possible with DSS-14 both transmitting and receiving. Thus far in 2015, we have used the GBT receiver in combination with the 450 kW DSS-14 antenna and a new low-power 80kW transmitter on the 34-m DSS-13 antenna at the Goldstone complex to image five and two NEAs respectively. Asteroids 2005 YQ96, 2004 BL86, and 1994 AW1 are binary systems. 2011 UW158 has a spin period of 36 minutes that is unusually fast among asteroids its size (~500 m). 1999 JD6 is a deeply bifurcated double-lobed object. 2015 HM10 is an elongated 80 m asteroid with a spin period of 22 minutes. Our best images of these objects resolve the surface with resolutions of 3.75 m and reveal numerous features.

But the vast majority of the time, they are plainly imperceptible. One of the significant cases are the Chelyabinsk impact. Moving on its orbit around the Sun, it approached us in the daylight sky - totally hidden in the Sun's glare. So far, only four impact events have been successfully forecasted in advance.

This paper focuses on doing a case study of the asteroids that have impacted the earth and by using the simulation software, a complete research evaluation will be done on possible immediate and long-term effects of the future impactors on our planet. The motive of the paper is to develop an iterative simulation technique that would predict the possible effect of future impact by analyzing the collected data from the previous asteroids that have hit the earth.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present the last results on the dynamics of Near-Earth asteroids with orbital semimajor axes smaller than 2 AU and we concentrate particularly on the dynamics of the secular resonances with planets. Many numerical integrations of NEA orbits show that the secular resonances are present in this region and that their effects can play a major role in the orbital evolutions and dynamical lifetimes of small bodies. They can either provide a protection mechanism from close approaches, or a transport mechanism from a region of the phase space to another. Moreover the recent location of all the linear secular resonances, by means of a semi-analytical method, confirms that all of them are present in this region and some can even overlap. This shows that the region of the inner planets is dynamically very complex and therefore, that a dynamical model considering only the effects of close encounters with planets to study the evolution of NEAs may be oversimplified and should take into account the secular perturbations and resonances which appear to be numerous and relevant in the region where NEAs evolve.", "title": ["Dynamical behaviour of Near-Earth asteroids in the terrestrial planet region : the role of secular resonances"], "year": "1998"}

The images achieve resolutions as fine as 75 m in range and place hundreds of pixels on the primary. The images provide thorough rotational coverage by the primary and reveal a rounded, slightly elongated object with a visible extent of 0.9 km. If the visible extent is about \u00bd of the actual extent, which would be true for a sphere, then the equatorial diameter is about 1.8 km. The primary has features along its leading edge that resemble the signature of the pronounced ridge on the equator of binary asteroid (66391) 1999 KW4. The images sample a wide range of orbital positions by the secondary, resolve it in range and Doppler frequency, show that it is elongated and roughly 500 m in diameter, and suggest that its rotation is synchronous (or nearly so) with the orbital period of 16.1 h estimated by Scheirich and Pravec (2009, Icarus 200, 531-547). We observe a maximum range separation of 2.5 km that, combined with the nearly circular eccentricity found by Scheirich and Pravec from inversion of lightcurves, establishes a lower bound on the semimajor axis. 1996 FG3 has a circular polarization ratio SC/OC = 0.34\u00b10.02 that is comparable to that of 25143 Itokawa (0.28\u00b10.04), suggesting similar degrees of near-surface roughness.

{"abstract": "The potential effects of an asteroid passing within close proximity to the Earth were recently realized. During the February 16, 2013 event, Asteroid 2012 DA14 passed within an estimated 27,700 kilometers of the earth, well within the geosynchronous (GEO) orbital belt. This was the closest known approach of a planetoid of this size, in modern history. The GEO belt is a region that is filled with critical communications satellites which provide relays for essential government, business and private datum. On the day of the event, optical instruments at Detachment 3, 21OG, Maui GEODSS were able to open in marginal atmospheric conditions, locate and collect metric and raw video data on the asteroid as it passed a point of near heliocentric orbital propinquity to the Earth. Prior to the event, the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) used propagated trajectory data from NASA's Near Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to assess potential collisions with man-made objects in Earth orbit. However, the ability to actively track this asteroid through the populated satellite belt not only allowed surveillance for possible late orbital perturbations of the asteroid, but, afforded the ability to monitor possible strikes on all other orbiting bodies of anthropogenic origin either not in orbital catalogs or not recently updated in those catalogs. Although programmed only for tracking satellites in geocentric orbits, GEODSS was able to compensate and maintain track on DA14, collecting one hundred and fifty four metric observations during the event.", "title": ["Tracking a Very Near Earth Asteroid"], "year": "2013"}
{"abstract": "Amethod for preventing the collisions of hazardous celestial objects with the Earth by diverting them from the trajectory of their encounter with the Earth is investigated. For this purpose, we propose to use small near-Earth asteroids that are transferred to the trajectories of a gravity-assist maneuver near the Earth by imparting a comparatively small velocity impulse to them. As a result of such a maneuver, a small asteroid is thrown into the hazardous object's interception orbit. The asteroids suitable for achieving this goal are chosen by solving Lambert's problem. The same concept is investigated for the problem of transferring asteroids to orbits resonant with the Earth's orbit so as to open up the possibility of regular missions to such asteroids with the goal of studying them and using their resources. The choice is made by minimizing the mentioned velocity impulse, whose admissible value is assumed to be within the limits that do not exceed 20 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>.", "title": ["Control of the motion of near-Earth asteroids"], "year": "2015"}

{"abstract": "MarcoPolo-R is a sample return mission to a primitive Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) selected in February 2011 for the Assessment Study Phase in the framework of ESA's Cosmic Vision 2 program. MarcoPolo-R is a European-led mission with a proposed NASA contribution. MarcoPolo-R takes advantage of three industrial studies completed as part of the previous Marco Polo mission (see ESA/SRE (2009)3). The aim of the new Assessment Study is to reduce the cost of the mission while maintaining its high science level, on the basis of advanced studies and technologies, optimization of the mission, and consolidation of the collaboration with other partners (NASA, AEB\u2026). The main goal of the MarcoPolo-R mission is to return unaltered NEA material for detailed analysis in ground-based laboratories. The limited sampling provided by meteorites does not offer the most primitive material available in near-Earth space. More primitive material, having experienced less alteration on the asteroid, will be more friable and would not survive atmospheric entry in any discernible amount. Only in Earth laboratories can instruments measure the individual components of the complex mixture of materials that forms an asteroid regolith with the necessary precision and sensitivity to determine their precise chemical and isotopic composition. Such measurements are vital for revealing the evidence of stellar, interstellar medium, pre-solar nebula and parent body processes that are retained in primitive asteroidal material, unaltered by atmospheric entry or terrestrial contamination. It is no surprise therefore that sample return missions are considered a priority by a number of the leading space agencies. MarcoPolo-R will rendezvous with a unique kind of target, a primitive binary NEA, scientifically characterize it at multiple scales, and return a unique pristine sample to Earth unaltered by the atmospheric entry process or terrestrial weathering. The baseline target of MarcoPolo-R is the primitive binary NEA (175706) 1996 FG3, which offers a very efficient operational and technical mission profile. A binary target also provides enhanced science return: the choice of this target will allow new investigations to be performed including those of the fascinating geology and geophysics of asteroids that are impossible to obtain from a single object. Precise measurements of the mutual orbit and rotation state of both components can be used to probe higher-level harmonics of the gravitational potential, and therefore the internal structure. A unique opportunity is offered to study the dynamical evolution driven by the YORP/ Yarkovsky thermal effects. Possible migration of regolith on the primary from poles to equator allows the increasing maturity of asteroidal regolith with time to be expressed as a latitude-dependent trend, with the most-weathered material at the equator matching what is seen in the secondary. MarcoPolo-R will allow us to study the most primitive materials available to investigate early solar system formation processes. Moreover, MarcoPolo-R will provide a sample from a known target with known geological context. Direct investigation of both the regolith and fresh interior fragments is also impossible by any means other than sample return.", "title": ["MarcoPolo-R: Near Earth Asteroid Sample Return Mission in ESA assessment study phase"], "year": "2012"}

This object was discovered by the Siding Spring Survey in May 2009 and subsequently observed in the late summer using the Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) and Arecibo (2380 MHz, 12.6 cm) radar systems from August 22-29 as well as with the SpeX instrument on the NASA IRTF on August 30 and September 21. Radar images reveal a roughly spheroidal body about 1.2 km in diameter that is slightly asymmetric and elongated. Tracking of surface features and the echo bandwidth suggest a period near 12 hours, which is in agreement with a period of 11.768 hours found from lightcurve observations (P. Pravec, pers. comm.). A consistent decrease in echo bandwidth during the radar observations implies the line of sight was moving away from the equator. Radar images with resolution as fine as 7.5 m per pixel show an indentation on the leading edge (possibly a crater) and radar-bright features beyond the leading edge. The S-band circular polarization ratio of 0.25 is near the median observed among near-Earth asteroids. Thermal emission between 2 and 4 microns is essentially unchanged in SpeX observations three weeks apart despite a change in phase angle from 98 deg to 49 degrees and an increase in heliocentric distance by 0.1 AU. Furthermore, the thermal parameters derived for 2009 KC3 during a single observation do not accurately predict the thermal emission at a later time in a different viewing geometry. Determination of the shape and spin pole will help us understand how much rotation phase and illumination effects affected the thermal observations.", "title": ["Characterization of Near-Earth Asteroid 2009 KC3 from Radar and Thermal Infrared Observations"], "year": "2010"}
{"abstract": "Thermal drag, a variant of the Yarkovsky effect, may act on small asteroids with sizes from a few meters to a few tens of meters. Yarkovsky thermal drag comes from an asteroid's absorbing sunlight in the visible and reradiating it in the infrared. Since the infrared photons have momentum, by action-reaction, they kick the asteroid when they leave its surface. The reradiation, which is asymmetric in latitude over the asteroid, gives a net force along the asteroid's pole. Due to the asteroid's thermal inertia, averaging this force over one orbital period produces a net drag if the spin axis has a component in the orbital plane. Thermal drag tends to circularize orbits. It can increase or decrease orbital inclinations. An object whose spin axis points in random directions over its lifetime displays little change in orbital inclination. Thermal drag appears to have little to do with the delivery of chondrites from the asteroid belt; the thermal drag timescale (10<SUP>8</SUP> years for meter-sized objects) is long compared with their cosmic ray exposure ages, and aphelia in the asteroid belt are not expected for mature thermal drag orbits. However, Yarkovsky thermal drag may act on the recently discovered near-Earth asteroids, which have radii of 10-30 m. Asteroid 1992 DA, for instance, might have its orbit shrunk by 0.1 AU in 3 x 10<SUP>7</SUP> years, removing it from an Earth-crossing orbit. The near-Earth asteroids also tend to have small to moderate orbital eccentricities, as expected for highly evolved thermal drag objects. However, the time needed to bring them in from the asteroid belt (about 10<SUP>9</SUP> years) is long compared with the collisonal and dynamical lifetimes (both about 10<SUP>8</SUP> years) for Earth-crossing objects, arguing against their emplacement by thermal drag.", "title": ["Asteroid orbit evolution due to thermal drag"], "year": "1995"}

It seems likely that current technology is sufficiently mature to field a relatively inexpensive mission, in which most of the thermal constraints are met by means of passive cooling.

The trajectory and orbit of the fireball were computed using multi-station data from the Polish Fireball Network. The results indicate that the orbit of the meteoroid that caused the PF131010 fireball is similar to the orbit of asteroid 2010 TB54 and both bodies may be related. Moreover, 2 d before the appearance of the Ciechan\u00f3w fireball, another small asteroid, 2010 SX11, passed close to the Earth-Moon system. Its orbit is even more similar to the orbit of the Ciechan\u00f3w fireball's parent body than 2010 TB54.

Under an agreement between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of the California Institute of Technology and the U. S. Air Force, JPL is provided access to a 1.0 m telescope located at the 3000 m summit of Haleakala crater in Maui, Hawaii. During NEAT operations, a thermo-electrically cooled CCD camera, constructed by JPL using a Lockheed 4K x 4K CCD with 15 micron pixels and 4-quadrant readout, is mounted at the f/2.15 Ritchey-Cretian focus, thus providing a 2.6 sq. deg. field. High-speed electronics built by San Diego State University control the CCD and read out the full-resolution image in 20 sec. An on-site JPL computer is programmed to move the telescope through a scripted sequence of positions, to acquire CCD images, and to measure the position and brightness of every moving object. By scripting 20 sec exposures every 40 secs, this system can image up to 1000 sq. deg. thrice nightly to magnitude limit V=19.5, and can detect asteroids with 90% efficiency to V=18. As of April 1998, NEAT has surveyed approx. 26000 sq. deg., detected approx. 23000 asteroid, and discovered 28 new NEOs. The current rate of NEO detections, including incidental redetections, is about 2 per 1000 sq. deg., of which half are larger than 1 km.

This research investigates the feasibility of stationing reusable cargo spacecraft, such as habitats, in halo orbits at Sun-Earth Libration points 1 and 2 (L<SUB>1</SUB> and L<SUB>2</SUB>) between NEA missions in an effort to reduce mission cost and thus overall campaign cost by lowering the mass required to be launched and the amount of new hardware to be built for each mission. Four example missions to the two currently most promising targets of the known NEA population in the 2025-2030 time frame are chosen. In the mission architecture proposed in this study, the crew vehicle directly commutes between Earth and the asteroid in order to keep mission durations for the crew short. The cargo vehicle departs from a halo orbit, rendezvous with the crew vehicle on the outbound trajectory, and returns to a halo orbit after the mission. Manifold trajectories of halo orbits in the northern and southern halo orbit family at L<SUB>1</SUB> and L<SUB>2</SUB> are considered for the transfer of the cargo vehicle to and from the interplanetary trajectory and the total \u0394v required for this transfer is minimized. This \u0394v is found to range from a few meters per second to hundreds of meters per second, depending on the specific energy and inclination of the interplanetary trajectory.

The near-Earth object (NEO) population is composed of asteroids and comets that have orbits close to the Earth. This population is the most accesible vestige from the building blocks that formed the Solar System, for spacecrafts, and for detailed observations from ground-based facilities. The proximity of these objects give us advantages, but also risks. The NEO Rapid Observation, Characterization and Key Simulations (NEOROCKS) project has been recently funded (2020-2022) through the H2020 European Commission programme to improve the knowledge on NEOs by connecting expertise in performing small body astronomical observations and the related modelling needed to derive their dynamical and physical properties. The IAC, and in particular members of the Solar System Group, participate in the NEOROCKS project and are currently leading one specific task to do observations of NEOs in support of the Arecibo Planetary Radar Program, using the facilities located at the Observatorios de Canarias (OOCC) and managed by IAC. These observations include times-series photometry (light curves), visible to near-infrared spectroscopy, and color photometry. We are focusing in those targets observed in the past by the Arecibo telescope and which have high signal-to-noise (SNR) radar data. In this work we present the results obtained for asteroid (159402) 1999 AP10.Observations. Our observations included spectroscopy and time-series photometry - over the visible wavelength. Spectroscopic data were obtained with the ALFOSC spectrograph at the 2.5-m Nordical Optical Telescope (NOT), located at the El Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma). A solar analogue star was observed at the same airmass as that of the asteroid. Data reduction followed standard procedures and was done using IRAF tasks. The spectra were bias and flat-field corrected before extracted and collapsed to one dimension. We wavelength calibrated both the spectra of the asteroid and solar analogue using ThAr+Ne+He lamps. In a final step, we divided the spectrum of the asteroid by the spectrum of the solar analogue to obtain the asteroid reflectance. In the attempt to obtain the rotational properties as rotational period, spin direction and shape model for the asteroid (159402) 1999 AP10, we did light curve observations between 2020 and 2021 using the TAR2 at TAR (Remote Open Telescope, Telescopio Abierto Remoto) installation. This telescope is a robotic observatory with two 42 cm diameter Centurion telescopes (TAR1 and TAR2), equipped with high-sensitivity FLI-Kepler sCMOS cameras and located at Teide Observatory (Tenerife). The observations at TAR2 were performed using the clear filter. To process the photometric images and to obtain the magnitudes we used the Photometry Pipeline (PP) developed by Mommert (2017). We used the software MPO Canopus to obtain the rotational period from the light curves. For the determination of the photometric shape model, we used the programs described by the model from Kaasalainen and Torppa (2001) and Kaasalainen et al., (2001).Results. In Fig. 1, we present the spectrum over the visible wavelengths of the asteroid (159402) 1999 AP10, it is normalized to unity at 0.55 \u03bcm (black points). We used the M4AST Tool (Popescu et al. 2012; http://spectre.imcce.fr/m4ast/index.php/index/home) to obtain a taxonomical classification of this object, finding that it best fits into the S-complex (DeMeo et al. 2009), i.e., it is composed mainly of silicates.Figure 1: The spectrum of (159402) 1999 AP10 (black points). The spectral curve is normalized to unity at 0.55 \u03bcm. Using the M4AST we have the curve of the best fit in red lines from taxonomic classification of Sv-type.Time-series photometry is a very efficient technique to obtain asteroid physical properties like rotation period, spin orientation, size, and shape. In the JPL webpage (https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi) the rotational period for the asteroid (159402) 1999 AP10 is 7.908 h. Using our light curves (with MPO Canopus), we obtain a rotational period of 7.9176 +/- 0.0152 h, and a light curve amplitude of 0.28 mag. The Fig.2 shows the light curves used to find the best fit and the rotational period. The obtained value for the period is in good agreement with the one listed at JPL. Figure 2: Three light curves of the asteroid (159402) 1999 AP10 from January, 2021. We did the fit on MPO Canopus and we obtained the rotational period of 7.917 +/- 0.0152 h and a light curve amplitude of 0.28.By obtaining rotational data from an asteroid at different viewing geometries allows to determine its photometric shape model (Kaasalainen and Torppa 2001; Kaasalainen et al. 2001). We observed the asteroid (159402) 1999 AP10 at several viewing geometries. Thus, we will present two preliminary photometric shape models, the first with only the data obtained by us and the second with our data plus data from the Asteroid Lightcurve Photometry Database.

{"abstract": "We report Goldstone delay-Doppler radar imaging of four NEAs obtained during February-June 2017. The signal-to-noise ratios were very strong for each object and we obtained detailed images with range resolutions as fine as 3.75 m/pixel. Delay-Doppler imaging revealed that 2017 BQ6 is a strikingly angular object roughly ~200 m in diameter with a rotation period of ~3 h. The multi-faceted shape is puzzling assuming a rubble-pile structure of this asteroid. 2017 CS was discovered by Pan-STARRS 1 on February 2 and approached within 8 lunar distances on May 29. 2017 CS appears rounded on large scales but has considerable fine-scale topography evident along its leading edges. The images suggest a diameter of ~1 km and rotation visible in the images is consistent with the 40 h rotation period obtained independently by from photometry by P. Pravec (pers. comm.). The highest resolution images show evidence for meter-size boulders, ridges, and broad concavities. 2007 WV4 was imaged in late May and early June. 2007 WV4 appears distinctly angular, with a diameter in the realm of 900 meters, and with at least three large facets more than 100 m in extent. Tracking of features in the images gives a rotation period of about 12 hours. The echoes show a persistent, small topographic feature that extends out from the surface. The nature of this feature is unknown, but it may be a large boulder similar to Yoshinodai seen on 25143 Itokawa. 2014 JO25 approached within 4.6 lunar distances on April 19. This was the closest encounter by an asteroid with an absolute magnitude brighter than 18 known in advance until 2027, when 1999 AN10 will approach within one lunar distance. Radar imaging shows that 2014 JO25 is an irregular object, which consists of two components connected by a narrow neck. The asteroid has a long axis of about 1 km and a short axis of roughly 600 m. The 3.75 m range resolution imaging placed thousands of pixels on the object and reveals ridges, hills, concavities, flat regions up to 200 meters long, and radar-bright spots that are probably boulders. Tracking of features in the images yields a rotation period of about 4.5 hours that is among the fastest of the ~50 known contact binaries in the near-Earth population.", "title": ["Goldstone radar images of near-Earth asteroids (469896) 2007 WV4, 2014 JO25, 2017 BQ6, and 2017 CS"], "year": "2017"}

{"abstract": "Amateur astronomers can support radar observations of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) principally by obtaining astrometry for objects with poorly-determined orbits and by obtaining lightcurves to estimate rotation periods and pole directions. The number of NEAs observed by radar has accelerated sharply in the last few years and the need for support has increased significantly. Optical astrometry is necessary for radar targets when the 3-sigma plane-of- sky pointing uncertainty is larger than about 15 arcseconds because the Are- cibo and Goldstone radar telescopes have narrow beam widths. Astrometry is particularly important for newly-discovered targets-of-opportunity, which of- ten have large plane-of-sky, Doppler, and range uncertainties. <P />Photometric observations assist radar observations of asteroids in several important ways: <P />1. The rotation period and pole direction are very helpful for planning radar observations. We use the spin vector to estimate signal-to-noise ratios and to compute longitude and latitude coverage, which help justify requests for telescope time. 2. If the spin vector is available, it greatly facilitates inverting delay- Doppler radar data to construct an asteroid's three-dimensional shape. This is probably the most important way that photometry can support radar observations. 3. Lightcurves can be used with radar data (and independently) to reconstruct asteroid shapes and spin states. 4. Lightcurve observations can discover and characterize the orbital and ro- tation periods of binary NEAs and can complement sparse radar observa- tions. Combined radar + lightcurve observations can yield binary NEA orb- ital parameters, masses, and bulk densities. 5. For asteroids with irregular shapes and well-determined spin states, photometric and radar observations during future close approaches may re- veal changes in the spin state due to thermal torques caused by absorption and and re-emission of sunlight (the \"YORP\" effect). If detected, the magnitude of the change can constrain the object's mass, density, and thermal conductivity. 6. For Doppler-only datasets, if the rotation period becomes available, the object's Doppler roadening (bandwidth) and rotation period yield its pole- on dimensions, which constrain the shape, radar and optical albedos, and composition. <P />To date, 147 near-Earth asteroids have been detected by radar at Arecibo and/or Goldstone. Rotation periods have been reported for only about one-half of those objects and pole directions are available for an even smaller per- centage. If more rotation periods and pole directions were available, they would enable us to reconstruct more asteroid shapes and they would greatly increase the value of many unpublished radar observations. The need for photometric observations is great and we strongly encourage observations by amateur astronomers.", "title": ["Contributions by Amateur Astronomers to Support Radar Imaging of Near-Earth Asteroids"], "year": "2004"}
{"abstract": "Radar observations of near-Earth asteroids have revealed a heterogeneous population with diameters spanning meter to kilometer scales, diverse shapes ranging from simple spheroids to extremely irregular bodies, rotation periods stretching from minutes to weeks, and a spectrum of surface properties. Since 1998, the Arecibo Observatory S-band radar system has detected over 400 near-Earth asteroids. We find the radar-observed near-Earth asteroid population with absolute magnitude H &lt; 21 is not dominated by a single category of basic shape: spheroids, multiple-asteroid systems, double-lobed contact binaries, elongated bodies, or irregularly shaped asteroids. A radar-observed binary fraction of 14% (N = 38; including two triple-asteroid systems) among near-Earth asteroids with H &lt; 21 is in agreement with optical observations, while contact binaries account for a similar fraction (14%; N = 38). At smaller sizes, binaries and contact binaries are much rarer, with only three binaries and one contact binary with H &lt; 21 detected thus far. The spin distribution of near-Earth asteroids estimated from radar matches very well with the spin distribution determined from optical lightcurves, including the well-known spin barrier for bodies with H &lt; 21 and the curious lack of small, slowly rotating bodies with H &gt; 21, despite different biases in these observing techniques. The shape and spin distributions of near-Earth asteroids observed with radar both show a distinct change in the population around H of 21 or 22 (100- to 200-m diameters), possibly indicating fundamental structural changes at this scale. Beyond constraining overall sizes and shapes, radar images as fine as 7.5-m resolution with Arecibo, akin to a low-cost flyby, reveal asteroid surfaces with ridges, concavities, crater-like depressions, angular facets, and boulders, details that constrain regolith properties and affect our understanding of geophysics in microgravity. Furthermore, the integrated surface properties of radar albedo and polarization ratio correlate with some spectral types, and thus composition.", "title": ["Physical Diversity of Near-Earth Asteroids from Arecibo Radar Observations"], "year": "2015"}

{"abstract": "Thermal inertia is the physical parameter that controls the temperature distribution over the surface of an asteroid. It affects the strength of the Yarkovsky effect, which causes orbital drift of km-sized asteroids and is invoked to explain the delivery of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from the main belt. Moreover, measurements of thermal inertia provide information on the presence or absence of loose surface material, such as thermally insulating regolith or dust. <P />At present, very little is known about the thermal inertia of asteroids in the km size range. Using an extensive dataset of thermal infrared observations obtained at the Keck 1, the ESO 3.6m and the IRTF telescopes, we find that the mean thermal inertia of near-Earth asteroids in the km-size range is 200 \u00b1 50 J m<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-0.5</SUP> K<SUP>-1</SUP> corresponding to a surface thermal conductivity of 0.03 \u00b1 0.01 W m<SUP>-1</SUP>K<SUP>-1</SUP>. <P />Combining this result with published values of asteroid thermal inertias, we also identify a trend of increasing thermal inertia with decreasing asteroid size. As a consequence, the dependence of the Yarkovsky-induced semimajor axis drift rate on object diameter, D, departs from the 1/D dependence commonly assumed in models of the dynamical evolution of asteroids.", "title": ["Thermal Inertia of near-Earth Asteroids and Strength of the Yarkovsky Effect"], "year": "2006"}
{"abstract": "Determining key physical properties of asteroids such as sizes and albedos or reflectance spectra is crucial to understand their origins and the processes that they have undergone during their evolution. In particular, one of the aims of NEOShield-2 project, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme, is to physically characterize small near Earth asteroids (NEA) in an effort to determine effective mitigation strategies in case of impact with our planet [Harris et al. 2013 2013AcAau,90,80H].We performed thermophysical modelling of NEAs, such as (1685) Toro, and potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), such as (33342) 1998 WT24. In addition to size, thermophysical models (TPM) of asteroids can constrain the surface thermal inertia, which is related to the material composition and physical nature, namely its \"rockiness\" or typical size of the particles on its surface. These have observable effects on the surface temperature distribution as a function of time and thus on the thermal infrared fluxes we observe, to which we can fit our model.In the case of WT24, its thermal inertia has been previously constrained to be in the range 100-300 SI units [Harris et al. 2007, Icarus 188, 414H]. But this was based on a spherical shape model approximation since no shape model was available by the time. Such a low thermal inertia value seems in disagreement with a relatively high metal content of the enstatite chondrites, the meteorite type to which WT24, classified as an E-type [Lazzarin et al. 2004 A&amp;A 425L, 25L], has been spectrally associated. Using a three-dimensional model and spin vector based on radar observations [Busch et al. 2008 Icarus 197, 375B], our TPM produces a higher best-fitting value of the thermal inertia. We also find the intriguing possibility that the hemisphere of WT24 dominated by concave terrains, possibly be the result of an impact crater, has a higher thermal inertia. This would be similar to the case of our Moon, where young impact craters are rockier than older craters covered by fully developed (i.e., fine-grained) regolith resulting from the erosion of the rocks exposed to the space environment for longer time scales.", "title": ["Thermal inertia as an indicator of rockiness variegation on near-Earth asteroid surfaces"], "year": "2016"}
{"abstract": "Asteroid capture holds great significance in understanding the origins of asteroids, the source of life, and the exploration of planetary mineral resources. To ensure the success of a mission aimed at capturing asteroids, it is crucial to choose asteroids that can be naturally captured by Earth. This article focuses on the orbital characteristics of temporarily captured asteroids. Through a statistical simulation of asteroid motion and an analytical derivation of the Jacobian integral, the necessary conditions for the temporary capture of asteroids by Earth are calculated. The analysis results show an approximately linear relationship between the orbit elements of temporarily captured asteroids. This condition is used to screen the currently observed near-Earth asteroids and has identified asteroids such as 2006 RH120 and 2020 CD3, which have been temporarily captured by Earth. These findings provide important suggestions for future asteroid capture missions and target selection.", "title": ["Necessary condition for temporary asteroid capture"], "year": "2023"}

Current theoretical studies predict that Trojan asteroids are a frequent by-product of the planet formation. This is not only the case for the outer giant planets, but also for the terrestrial planets in the inner Solar System. By using numerical integrations, we investigated the capture efficiency and the stability of the captured objects. We found out that the capture efficiency is larger for the planets in the inner Solar System compared to the outer ones, but most of the captured Trojan asteroids are not long term stable. These temporary captures caused by chaotic behaviour of the objects were investigated without any dissipative forces. They show an interesting dynamical behaviour of mixing, like jumping from one Lagrange point to the other one.", "title": ["Trojan capture by terrestrial planets"], "year": "2012"}

The NEARBY platform was built and is available at UTCN since Feb 2018, being tested during 5 pilot surveys observed in 2017-2018 with the Isaac Newton Telescope in La Palma. Two NEAs were discovered in Nov 2018 (2018 VQ1 and 2018 VN3), being recovered and reported to MPC within 2 hours. Other 4 discovered NEAs were found from a few dozen possible NEA candidates promptly being followed, allowing us to discover 22 Hungarias and 7 Mars crossing asteroids using the NEARBY platform. Compared with other few available software, NEARBY could detect more asteroids (by 8-41 %), but scores less than human detection (by about 10 %).

{"abstract": "Ground-based optical telescopes suffer from a blind zone surrounding the Sun. In this article, two telescopes were proposed to be deployed on an Earth\u2011leading heliocentric orbit approximately 10 million kilometers ahead of the Earth to warn of asteroids approaching Earth from the sunward direction.

Based on Granvik's impactor and near-Earth asteroid (NEA) populations, the warning efficiency of the Earth\u2011leading heliocentric orbiting telescopes for asteroids approaching Earth from the sunward direction was simulated. The simulation results show that under the designed search strategy, with a limiting apparent magnitude of 24, the warning efficiency of two Earth\u2011leading heliocentric orbiting telescopes for impactors and NEAs approaching Earth from the sunward direction reaches 99.0% and 94.3% (with 0.4% and 0.8% uncertainty, respectively) within 6 years, which is 95.8% and 57.5% (with 0.7% and 1.7% uncertainty, respectively) for one telescope deployed on an Earth\u2011leading heliocentric orbit and 22.1% (with 1.5% uncertainty) for two telescopes deployed on a Sun-Earth L1 orbit.

{"abstract": "Asteroid crater retention ages have unknown accuracy because projectile-crater scaling laws are difficult to verify. At the same time, our knowledge of asteroid and crater size-frequency distributions has increased substantially over the past few decades. These advances make it possible to empirically derive asteroid crater scaling laws by fitting model asteroid size distributions to crater size distributions from asteroids observed by spacecraft. For D &gt; 10 km diameter asteroids like Ceres, Vesta, Lutetia, Mathilde, Ida, Eros, and Gaspra, the best matches occur when the ratio of crater to projectile sizes is f \u223c 10. The same scaling law applied to 0.3 &lt; D &lt; 2.5 km near-Earth asteroids such as Bennu, Ryugu, Itokawa, and Toutatis yield intriguing yet perplexing results.

These ages agree with the estimated formation ages of their source families and could suggest that the near-Earth asteroid population is dominated by bodies that avoided disruption during their traverse across the main asteroid belt. An alternative interpretation is that f \u226b 10, which would make their crater retention ages much younger. If true, crater scaling laws need to change in a substantial way between D &gt; 10 km asteroids, where f \u223c 10, and 0.3 &lt; D &lt; 2.5 km asteroids, where f \u226b 10.", "title": ["Interpreting the Cratering Histories of Bennu, Ryugu, and Other Spacecraft-explored Asteroids"], "year": "2020"}
{"abstract": "AIDA (Asteroid Impact &amp; Deflection Assessment) is an international collaboration between NASA and ESA which involves both DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test, NASA) and Hera (ESA) missions. The target is an asteroid of approximately 160 m in size, namely the secondary of the binary Near-Earth Asteroid (65803) Didymos. Little is known about the shape of the satellite, with a moderately elongated shape (b/a&lt;1.2) compatible with available ground-based estimations. In this work we investigate the possible reaction of the target to the DART collision to be performed in 2022, under the assumption that it is a gravitational aggregate produced in the formation of the binary system. The very structure of the target is unknown, therefore we model it by (1) mono- and multi-dispersed distributions of spherical basic elements and by (2) considering irregular components. We perform numerical simulations of the collision event by using a discrete-element N-body numerical code (PKDGRAV-SSDEM). We do not perform simulations of the shattering phase, we instead concentrate on the effect of the collision on the target, after the shattering phase implying material damage (melting, vaporization, heating and deformation), is over. Therefore, our synthetic projectile carries the same nominal momentum as the DART mission does, but it delivers to the target only the kinetic energy expected to survive once the shattering (non-elastic) phase has dissipated most of the impact kinetic energy. We account for different centre- and off-centre- possible impact geometry compatible with DART nominal impact angle with respect to the target orbital plane.Here we report on results obtained so far on the effects of the DART impact on the structure of the Didymos satellite, including changes in its spin period and direction of the direction of the spin axis, as well as change of shape.Moreover, we look at the velocity field of surface particles to infer if any motion is expected away from the impact point and regolith particles can be ejected from locations far from it.Such predictions may be of interest in the study of the post-impact dynamics of the system -that will be determined by the Hera mission measurements. This, in turn will help in the interpretation of the results of the outcome of the DART impact mission, including the determination of the momentum multiplication (beta) factor.", "title": ["Effects of the DART (NASA) mission collision on the structure and spin state of the secondary of the Near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos binary system."], "year": "2020"}

We present an asteroid taxonomy classification system based on reflectance spectrum characteristics for 371 asteroids measured over the wavelength range 0.45 to 2.45 \u03bcm. This system of 24 classes is constructed using principal component analysis, following most closely the visible wavelength taxonomy of Bus [Bus, S.J., 1999. Ph.D. thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology], which itself builds upon the system of Tholen [Tholen, D.J., 1984. Ph.D. thesis, University of Arizona]. Nearly all of the Bus taxonomy classes are preserved, with one new class (Sv) defined. For each class we present boundary definitions, spectral descriptions, and prototype examples. A flow chart method is presented for classifying newly acquired data spanning this wavelength range. When data are available only in the near-infrared range (0.85 to 2.45 \u03bcm), classification is also possible in many cases through an alternate flow chart process. Within our sample, several classes remain relatively rare: only 6 objects fall into the A-class; 349 Dembowska and 3628 Boznemcova reside as the only objects in their respective R- and O-classes.

However, OH/H2O has been discovered on other seemingly dry bodies in the inner Solar System, such as the Moon and Vesta, with recent discoveries of OH/H2O on the two largest NEAs. Possible sources for OH/H2O on these bodies include impacts of carbonaceous material and solar wind proton implantation, though the factors that control the latter mechanism are unclear.

{"abstract": "Meter-scale particles can appear in radar image as brightness speckles, ubiquitously distributed on the surface of asteroids in the inner Solar System. They are indicative of the presence of centimeter-to-decimeter scale particles (\"cobble\"). Their spatial and size distribution give us indications of the geological evolution and the outcome of the collision event history. The abundance of cobbles can be suggestive of whether the asteroid is monolithic or a rubble pile. We use radar observations by the Arecibo Observatory Planetary Radar Program. Arecibo radar system transmits a powerful circularly polarized signal using a frequency of 2380 MHz (wavelength of 12.6 cm) and receives the echo in the opposite circular (OC) polarization and same circular (SC) polarization. The quasi-specular reflection from a layer of fine-grained regolith and diffuse scattering by and between the wavelength-scale particles compose the OC polarized part of the echo. The intensity and the polarization are suggestive of the physical properties of the target's near-surface. Wavelength-scale particle distribution and near-surface densities of Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) are derived from the radar albedos in the SC and OC polarization states. We analyze the radar albedos in order to obtain wavelength-scale particles shape and size distribution as well as the effective near-surface bulk density of the underlying layer of sub-centimeter-scale particles. Here we investigate the physical properties of NEAs, specifically analyzing 1998 WT24, 1998 CS1, 1950 DA, and 2006 AM4 using state-of-the-art methodology of interpreting radar scattering.

NEOWISE employs an automated pipeline for the detection of moving objects, recording their astrometry and photometry and reporting positions to the Minor Planet Center for archiving. However, there are a subset of near-Earth objects that are not found by the automated system due to rates of motion or acceleration outside the pipeline limits, an insufficient number of detections, or confusion with background sources. Because NEOWISE archives every full-frame image obtained during the survey, detections of these objects can be recovered by manually searching the expected positions for coincident sources.We have performed searches for near-Earth objects in the NEOWISE archives from 2013 to 2019, recovering detections for over 400 objects and enabling fitting of their diameters and albedos (Masiero et al. 2018, Masiero et al. 2020).

Objects found through this technique tend to be smaller than those detected by the automated processing. The distribution of albedos for these objects is skewed to high reflectivities, as is expected for a population that is optically-selected.Here we present the results of our searches along with the physical properties of the recovered objects.

{"abstract": "Near-Earth asteroid 2012 TC4 approached within 0.00035 au (7 Earth radii of Earth's surface) on 2017 October 12. This was one of the closest near-Earth asteroid encounters known in advance and it provided an outstanding opportunity to investigate the physical properties of this object. Here we report radar observations obtained between 2017 Oct. 9-14 with the 70 m DSS-14 (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) and 34 m DSS-13 (7190 MHz, 4.2 cm) antennas at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex and with the 100 m Green Bank Telescope. 2012 TC4 has an absolute magnitude of 26.7, suggesting a diameter within a factor of two of 15 meters. Despite its diminutive size, the flyby was so close that we expected extremely strong radar signal-to-noise ratios. The highest resolution images were obtained on Oct. 12 using transmissions at DSS-13 and reception at Green Bank, and achieved a range resolution of 1.875 m/pixel that is the finest ever obtained at Goldsone and Green Bank for any near-Earth asteroid. The images reveal an elongated, angular, asymmetric, and rapidly rotating object and place lower bounds on its intermediate and long axes of about 6 x 12 meters. Combined with an effective diameter of 7-10 meters, the implication is that 2012 TC4 is an optically-bright object. The rotation evident in the images is consistent with the 12 minute period that is prominent in the lightcurves obtained by W. B. Ryan (pers. comm.). The ratio of same-sense circular (SC) to opposite-sense circular (OC) polarization, SC/OC, is about 0.55, which probably indicates that this object has an unusually rough near-surface at decimeter spatial scales. Circular polarization ratios have been obtained for hundreds of near Earth asteroids, and the ratio for 2012 TC4 overlaps the upper end of values reported for C- and SQ-class near-Earth asteroids and the lower end for E- and V-class objects. The radar images are suitable for estimation of the 3D shape and spin state. When combined with the area/mass ratio estimated independently from orbit fitting (D. Farnocchia, pers. comm.), the physical model will be used to obtain the mass and the bulk density, information that is generally not available for solar system objects in this size regime.", "title": ["Goldstone/Green Bank Radar Imaging of Near-Earth Asteroid 2012 TC4"], "year": "2018"}

{"abstract": "We present thermal infrared photometry and spectrophotometry of 7 Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) using the 3.8 m United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT), together with quasi-simultaneous optical observations of 3 NEAs using the 1.0 m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope (JKT). The asteroids were observed at phase angles ranging from 28 to 91. Effective diameters and albedos are derived from the fitting of the Standard Thermal Model (STM), the Fast Rotating Model (FRM) and the Near-Earth Asteroid Thermal Model to thermal spectra. Geometric albedos in the range p<SUB>v</SUB> = 0.02-0.50 and effective diameters D<SUB>eff</SUB> = 0.67-4.3 km are found. The applicability of these models at high phase angles is discussed. The NEATM allows the beaming parameter of the STM to be varied to force the model temperature to be consistent with the observed distribution, and uses a phase correction which assumes that there is zero emission on the night side. The NEATM provides more accurate diameter and albedo estimates than the STM and FRM for NEAs generally. However, NEAs with high thermal inertia and a fast rotation will have significant emission on the night side, resulting in an underestimation of the albedo and overestimation of the diameter using the NEATM at a high phase angle. Strategies for improving the reliability of diameter and albedo determinations at high phase angles by allowing the night side temperature to be non-zero are discussed.", "title": ["Thermal infrared and optical observations of near-Earth asteroids at high phase angle"], "year": "2004"}

{"abstract": "Since the discovery of Ida's companion in 1993, 195 companions of asteroids have been discovered. To understand the formation process of these interesting bodies, their physical properties such as their bulk density, size, shape, and surface roughness need to be determined. <P />During the Spitzer Cycle-4, we obtained IRS thermal emission spectra (5-42 um) of 23 known binary systems. The majority of asteroids are from the main-belt (16), while the rest are NEOs (7). After extracting the thermal spectra, we used a modified Standard Thermal Model (STM) to calculate their equivalent diameter (from 0.8 km to 237 km), their albedo (from 0.04 for C-type to 0.394 for a V-type) and their beaming factor related to the surface roughness and thermal inertia. We derive their emissivity spectra, which is useful to detect silicate features. <P />Combining these measurements with 3D-models of these multiple asteroid systems obtained by lightcurve inversion, we should be able to derive an accurate estimate of their bulk-density and contrast them with their taxonomic classes.

{"abstract": "The Hera mission is a proposed Discovery class mission to collect three samples from each of three near-Earth asteroids. Returned samples would have information on geological context and possibly stratigraphy, would provide fresh regolith, and conceivably samples that would not naturally reach the Earth. During the development of a simple touch-and-go sample collector, questions arose concerning the nature of the samples to be collected, their maximum science return, and the simplest engineering designs. This article reports the results of a small workshop convened to discuss this topic. It is argued that the maximum science return for the Hera samples would be obtained if asteroids of different major spectral classes were visited, samples were disturbed as little as possible during collection, and samples from the very surface were obtained. Surface samples would have the utmost value in interpreting links between asteroids and meteorites, would yield maximum information in solar exposure, would avoid planetary protection concerns, and would produce material not reaching Earth as meteorites. At the same time, they would be simpler to sample than subsurface samples.", "title": ["The Hera near-Earth asteroid sample return mission: science requirements of the sample collector"], "year": "2004"}
{"abstract": "Previous work indicated that a correlation may exist between radar-derived properties (e.g. circular polarization ratio, CPR) and visible IR taxonomic classes of near-Earth Asteroids [1]. Such a relationship may indicate distinct, near-surface material properties that are dependent on taxonomic class, different near-surface evolutions, or other factors such as geometric properties of the near-surface scatterers. Here, we investigate to what extent radar scattering properties can be used as constraints to the spectro-photometric taxonomic class determination, using Arecibo S-band (12 cm, 2380 MHz) planetary radar observations of 299 NEAs as our sample. For each object observed at Arecibo from 2008-2017, disk-integrated radar properties are derived using radar backscatter from continuous wave experiments. Additionally, we collected compositional information for each object as derived through their visible-infrared Tholen &amp; Bus-DeMeo taxonomy. For the purposes of this study, we focus on S-, C-, V- and X-type. We find that, to a high degree of confidence, CPR can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify E-type asteroids, whereby E-types have CPR &gt; 0.75. Because E-type asteroids are part of the X complex, which also includes M and P types, CPR can be used to help resolve this group into its sub-taxonomies. Although the other taxonomic classes cannot be confidently identified by their radar properties, results indicate they can be grouped into three clusters, whereby typically M and P types have CPR &lt; 0.3, S- and C-types have CPR within 0.2 and 0.4, and V types have CPR within 0.4 and 0.7. Therefore, taxonomic classes, in a statistical sense, are associated with CPR. Such a relationship may indicate distinct, near-surface material properties, which may be potentially derived from differences in their near-surface evolutions. Note that these derived relationships are significant only over the studied parameter space (i.e., for the range of asteroid sizes studied). Additionally, the dataset may be biased by sample size and biases in observations. Further characterization of these relationships requires modeling efforts and laboratory work in radar scattering processes. <P />1: Benner et al.

{"abstract": "In this paper we report results of three target of opportunity observations for Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) with the Southern Hemisphere Asteroid Radar Program (SHARP). All observations were conducted within two weeks of discovery, demonstrating a rapid response capability, enabling tracking of potentially hazardous asteroids that are only observable from the Southern Hemisphere. The three NEAs observed were: 2019 EA2, 2019 GC6, and 2019 SP3, the receiving system in each case being the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). For 2019 EA2, the observations were conducted on 2019 March 23, with a Tidbinbilla 34 m radio antenna transmitting (either DSS-34 or DSS-35). The asteroid was at a distance of 0.8 lunar distance. The observed Doppler-broadening bandwidth was 50 Hz, which is consistent with its known rapid rotation of 104 seconds. For 2019 GC6, the observations were conducted on 2019 April 18, with the Tidbinbilla 70 m antenna (DSS-43) or one 34 m antenna (DSS-35) transmitting. The asteroid was at a distance of 0.5 lunar distance. The observed Doppler-broadening of 0.2 Hz suggests a maximum rotation period of 12 hours for its 20m size estimated from optical observations. For 2019 SP3, the observations were conducted on 2019 October 2, with the 34 m radio antenna DSS-35 transmitting. The asteroid was at 1.7 lunar distances. No echo was detected.

Between 2010 and 2017 we have collected new optical and near infra-red observations of the potentially hazardous NEA (2102) Tantalus using ESO facilities. The lightcurve data is supplemented by radar imaging data available from Arecibo. The object appears to be very symmetrical showing a low amplitude lightcurve variation and no large-scale features in the radar images. Moreover, Tantalus' rotation rate is near its rotational fission limit, which means the asteroid was likely shaped through its fast spin.

{"abstract": "In the 6th edition of the Chinese Space Trajectory Design Competition held in 2014, a near-Earth asteroid sample-return trajectory design problem was released, in which the motion of the spacecraft is modeled in multi-body dynamics, considering the gravitational forces of the Sun, Earth, and Moon. It is proposed that an electric-propulsion spacecraft initially parking in a circular 200-km-altitude low Earth orbit is expected to rendezvous with an asteroid and carry as much sample as possible back to the Earth in a 10-year time frame. The team from the Technology and Engineering Center for Space Utilization, Chinese Academy of Sciences has reported a solution with an asteroid sample mass of 328 tons, which is ranked first in the competition. In this article, we will present our design and optimization methods, primarily including overall analysis, target selection, escape from and capture by the Earth\u2013Moon system, and optimization of impulsive and low-thrust trajectories that are modeled in multi-body dynamics.
